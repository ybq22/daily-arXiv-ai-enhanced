### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，通过扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，结合LiDAR支持，解决多传感器不一致性问题，渲染速度比现有方法快1.5-20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法存在渲染速度慢、仅支持针孔相机模型的问题，且多传感器模拟中存在跨传感器不一致性，限制了其在自动驾驶等应用中的实用性。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于射线的剔除，设计因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致性。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差平均降低40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，解决了多传感器模拟中的关键挑战，在自动驾驶测试中表现出优异的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SurgFUTR框架，将手术未来预测重构为状态变化学习，通过教师-学生架构和Action Dynamics模块实现跨手术程序的通用预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解正在发生的事件，而非预测未来事件。现有方法针对孤立任务，缺乏统一方法，且基于未来特征预测的方法难以在不同手术情境中泛化。

Method: 将手术未来预测重构为状态变化学习，使用教师-学生架构。通过Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频压缩为状态表示，教师网络学习当前和未来片段，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，由Action Dynamics模块指导。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个手术程序上的实验显示一致改进。跨程序转移验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: SurgFUTR通过状态变化学习框架有效解决了手术未来预测问题，在短期和长期预测任务上均表现出色，并具有良好的跨程序泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TMPS框架，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，仅使用少量目标域样本就能显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境外表现不佳，主要由于疾病症状的细微变化和领域差异，以及训练数据多样性不足。

Method: 基于度量学习，提出TMPS框架，利用少量目标域标记样本进行目标感知训练，结合优先采样策略。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型平均宏F1分数提升7.3-18.7个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS是一个简单但高效的学习框架，能显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的鲁棒性，仅需少量目标域样本即可实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个无需标签的视觉语言对齐增强框架，通过在训练中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，使现有VLM无需文本标签或完全重新训练就能生成改进的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性并导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用。

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐框架ViZer，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，实现零标签学习。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上应用ViZer，观察到一致的定性改进，生成的描述比基线更贴近图像且更具描述性。

Conclusion: ViZer为视觉语言任务中的零标签适应提供了实用起点，自动化评估指标如CIDEr和BERTScore往往会惩罚参考描述中缺失的细节。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专门针对胎儿超声的医学AI系统，通过引入显性认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的双分图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择，在胎儿超声报告生成和诊断任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，面临多视图推理、多种疾病和图像多样性等挑战。

Method: 提出显性认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的双分图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择。同时构建了FetalSigma-1M数据集，包含20K份来自12个医疗中心的胎儿超声报告。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线模型，平均增益+14%，在关键病症上的准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过显性认知解耦和强化学习的方法，有效解决了胎儿超声领域的多视图推理和疾病多样性问题，在报告生成和诊断任务上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级引导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，结合轻量级频谱EMA切换保守和细节寻求模式，提升图像锐度、提示遵循和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SD/SDXL模型在采样过程中细节生成不足、提示遵循性差和伪影控制不佳的问题，通过采样器级引导技术在不重新训练模型的情况下提升图像质量。

Method: 核心模块ZeResFDG整合三种技术：频率解耦引导重新加权引导信号的低频和高频分量；能量重缩放匹配引导预测的幅度；零投影移除无条件方向的分量。结合轻量级频谱EMA在采样过程中切换模式。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器中，ZeResFDG在中等引导尺度下显著改善了图像锐度、提示遵循性和伪影控制，无需重新训练。QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer进一步提升了鲁棒性并生成自然的高频微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一种有效的采样器级引导方法，显著提升SD/SDXL模型的图像生成质量，特别是在细节增强和伪影控制方面表现优异，且无需模型重新训练。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE是一个混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，相比传统堆叠编码器方法，在减少24-49%计算量的同时实现更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视觉编码器VLMs简单堆叠编码器会导致收益递减且计算成本倍增，需要更智能的编码器选择方法。

Method: 提出SCOPE框架，包含共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器使用文本提示与共享视觉特征的交叉注意力来选择最优编码器，采用双熵正则化和辅助损失训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享编码器+1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型，优于同时使用所有4个额外编码器的模型，同时减少24-49%计算量。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合方法，挑战了多编码器VLMs的主流范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

*Tanveer Hannan,Shuaicong Wu,Mark Weber,Suprosanna Shit,Jindong Gu,Rajat Koner,Aljoša Ošep,Laura Leal-Taixé,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位(SVAG)新任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中基于自然语言描述动作的所有参考对象，并构建了SVAG-Bench基准数据集和SVAGFormer基线框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决粗粒度动作识别或通用对象跟踪，忽视了根据动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并对其进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中，突显了在长视频中进行细粒度对象-动作交互推理的必要性。

Conclusion: SVAG任务对下一代AI系统至关重要，现有方法在此任务上的不足表明需要开发更先进的细粒度对象-动作交互推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

*Zhengxu Tang,Zizheng Wang,Luning Wang,Zitao Shuai,Chenhao Zhang,Siyu Qian,Yirui Wu,Bohao Wang,Haosong Rao,Zhenyu Yang,Chenwei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准，用于评估文本到视频生成中的序列叙事连贯性，包括320个提示的数据集和基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，揭示了当前T2V模型在保持多动作序列连贯性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V模型在生成需要逻辑进展的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，而现有基准主要关注视觉质量指标，缺乏对扩展序列叙事连贯性的评估。

Method: 构建包含320个提示的SeqBench数据集，涵盖不同叙事复杂度；设计基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，能够高效捕捉长程依赖和时序关系；使用8个最先进T2V模型生成2560个人工标注视频。

Result: 基于DTG的评估指标与人类标注表现出强相关性；系统评估揭示了当前T2V模型的关键局限：在多动作序列中无法保持一致的物体状态、多物体场景中产生物理上不合理的结果、难以保持顺序动作之间的现实时序和排序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成）将场景感知注入文本条件运动模型，利用不相关的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么关注运动语义，要么关注场景感知，但缺乏同时处理两者的方法，因为构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务来桥接两个不同的数据集。第一阶段引入关键帧层来调制运动潜在空间进行中间帧生成；第二阶段添加场景条件层，通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知注入文本到运动模型中，并分析了这种感知机制的出现方式。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战，通过创新的两阶段适应方法实现了场景感知的文本到运动生成。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，需要更有效的序列建模方法来提高心电图异常检测的准确性。

Method: 结合一维卷积特征提取和Mamba选择性状态空间模型，基于Vision Mamba双向变体增强心电图数据中时间依赖关系的表示。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2020和2021挑战赛上，该模型在12导联心电图上获得了显著高于现有最佳算法的AUPRC和AUROC分数。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的架构有潜力推进可靠的心电图分类，支持早期诊断和个性化治疗，同时提高远程医疗和资源受限医疗系统的可及性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [12] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验、能够实现真正新颖视角合成的自监督模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，实现了相机姿态与场景内容的解耦和几何推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新颖视角合成方法的预测姿态缺乏可迁移性——同一组姿态在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，这暴露了它们无法真正理解场景几何的问题。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视角几何概念，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量实现姿态与场景内容的解耦。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无姿态NVS变换器，实现了真正的姿态可迁移性，且潜在姿态与现实世界姿态高度相关。

Conclusion: 该研究表明无需显式3D几何表示也能实现真正的新颖视角合成，为自监督3D场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

Motivation: 现有学习方法使用梯度幅值损失会丢失方向信息，导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不足。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保留符号信息。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上验证了方法的有效性，能产生更清晰、对齐更好的边缘和更丰富的纹理。

Conclusion: 提出的方向感知梯度损失在不改变模型架构或训练协议的情况下，显著提升了图像融合的质量。

from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时，由于领域偏移（包括图像外观的风格差异和人群依赖的解剖特征内容差异）而表现不佳，特别是在海马体分割中面临内容变化挑战。

Method: 结合z-归一化进行高效风格协调，采用双向可变形图像配准策略，将配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在从年轻健康人群迁移到临床痴呆患者的海马体分割中，相比标准增强方法，Dice得分相对提升高达15%，在内容偏移较大的场景中增益最显著。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对不同人群间的海马体分割挑战，在内容偏移显著的情况下表现出色，为跨域医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了计数幻觉的概念，构建了CountHalluSet数据集套件，开发了标准化评估协议来量化扩散模型中的计数幻觉现象，并分析了不同采样条件对幻觉水平的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型在生成任务中取得了显著进展，但经常产生与现实世界知识冲突的幻觉样本，如生成不合理的重复对象。目前缺乏系统量化此类幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的数据集套件CountHalluSet，开发标准化评估协议，系统研究不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉水平的影响。

Result: 研究发现常用的图像质量指标FID无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件显著影响计数幻觉水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉现象迈出了第一步，为图像生成中幻觉现象的研究提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在高计算开销、内存消耗大以及视觉保真度不足的问题，导致时间不一致性和伪影。

Method: 引入时空特征记忆库缓存特征，采用特征最相似传播方法保持时间一致性，通过交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码，并将其集成到扩散去噪过程中。

Result: 在效率和视觉保真度方面优于现有最先进方法，验证了其优越的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest通过创新的时空特征管理和传播机制，实现了高效、高质量的文本驱动视频编辑，解决了现有方法的关键限制。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AR/VR技术普及，需要AI从第一人称视角理解人类社交动态，但当前LLMs缺乏社交意识，导致不恰当的干预时机选择，破坏自然对话和用户专注度。

Method: 构建了包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的EgoSocial数据集，并提出EgoSoD方法，该方法整合多模态上下文线索（音频和视觉）到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和互动。

Result: 实验显示当前OLLMs在检测干预时机方面表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%），而EgoSoD方法将Phi-4的干预时机性能提升45.6%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升9.9%；社交互动整体性能分别提升20.4%和6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法能有效检测社交动态和干预时机，解决了AI在社交场景中的干预时机选择问题，为AR/VR环境中的AI助手提供了更好的社交意识。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 改进现有的网格生成和微分同胚图像配准方法，旨在实现高精度配准的同时控制变换质量，确保空间变换的正雅可比行列式，并为神经影像工作流提供精确的逆变换。

Method: 采用变分原理(VP)网格生成方法，构建具有指定雅可比行列式和旋度的无折叠网格，在微分同胚群中生成逆变换而非图像空间操作。

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，基于35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数评估显示，VPreg在Dice分数、计算变换的规则性、逆映射的准确性和一致性方面均优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt等最先进方法。

Conclusion: VPreg通过变分原理方法在微分同胚图像配准中表现出优越性能，为计算解剖学和形态测量学提供了高质量的空间变换和精确的逆变换。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Motivation: 解决文本和图像模态间信息熵差异导致的跨模态检索不平衡问题，利用LLM的开放语义知识来填补熵差，模拟人类的对齐能力。

Method: 1) 设计不依赖任务域显式知识的提示模板，用LLM增强文本多义性描述；2) 使用超图适配器构建文本和图像间的多边连接，修正同义语义的正负匹配错误，同时通过降维映射减少开放语义熵带来的噪声。

Conclusion: 通过LLM增强文本信息熵和超图适配器的组合方法，有效解决了跨模态检索中的语义对齐挑战，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that

Conclusion: 利用TEM信号的固有物理特性作为先验知识，通过测试时自适应策略可以有效提升模型在新环境中的去噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Conclusion: STT-GS策略有效解决了边缘高斯泼溅中的因果困境，通过智能采样和资源分配优化了场景重建质量。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception

two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge

Conclusion: 通过发布基础设施和数据集，Paper Copilot帮助社区跟踪变化、诊断问题，为建立更稳健、透明和可靠的同行评审系统提供基于证据的改进依据。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

### [27] [MimicParts: Part-aware Style Injection for Speech-Driven 3D Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13208)
*Lianlian Liu,YongKang He,Zhaojie Chu,Xiaofen Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MimicParts框架，通过部位感知风格注入和去噪网络，从语音生成更具表现力的3D人体运动，解决了现有方法忽略区域运动风格差异和动态适应性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在从语音生成风格化3D人体运动时存在两个主要问题：一是过度简化风格多样性或忽略区域运动风格差异（如上身与下身）；二是未能让运动风格动态适应语音节奏和情感变化。

Method: MimicParts框架采用部位感知风格注入和部位感知去噪网络，将身体划分为不同区域来编码局部运动风格，并通过部位感知注意力块让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法，能够生成更自然和富有表现力的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts通过细粒度的区域风格编码和动态适应机制，显著提升了从语音生成风格化3D人体运动的真实感和表现力。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

TL;DR: 本文对视觉提示(VP)和视觉提示调优(VPT)进行了系统性综述，提出了统一的提示适应(PA)框架，并提供了分类体系、应用领域分析以及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT概念边界模糊，经常被互换使用，缺乏对这两种技术及其应用场景的系统性区分。

Method: 从第一性原理重新审视VP和VPT设计，将其概念化为统一的提示适应(PA)框架，提供基于可学习性(可学习、生成式、不可学习)和注入粒度(像素级、标记级)的分类体系。

Result: 构建了全面的PA方法论和应用综述，涵盖医学影像、3D点云、视觉语言任务等多个领域，并总结了当前基准和关键挑战。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面综述，旨在为研究人员和从业者提供清晰的路线图，以理解和探索PA相关研究的演进格局。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

*Hang-Cheng Dong,Yibo Jiao,Fupeng Wei,Guodong Liu,Dong Ye,Bingguo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向样本级别的表面缺陷检测框架，通过多任务学习联合优化样本分类和像素分割，解决传统像素级方法在样本决策稳定性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临前景-背景极度不平衡、缺陷稀疏且尺度分布长尾、对比度低等问题。现有模型在像素重叠指标上表现良好，但在样本级别决策稳定性不足，特别是对于稀疏或细长缺陷。根本原因是优化目标与质检决策粒度不匹配。

Method: 提出样本中心的多任务学习框架，基于共享编码器架构，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位。样本级监督调节特征分布，在梯度层面持续提升小缺陷和低对比度缺陷的召回率，分割分支则保留边界和形状细节以增强决策稳定性。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性。

Conclusion: 样本中心的多任务学习框架能够有效解决工业表面缺陷检测中的样本级决策稳定性问题，通过联合优化分类和分割任务，提升了对小缺陷和低对比度缺陷的检测能力。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

*Inha Kang,Youngsun Lim,Seonho Lee,Jiho Choi,Junsuk Choe,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块来解决视觉语言模型在否定理解上的affirmative bias问题，显著提升了否定检测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在理解否定概念时存在严重缺陷，特别是在描述性目标检测任务中表现出affirmative bias，即倾向于忽略否定词而做出肯定判断。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：1) CoVAND数据集，通过系统化的思维链和VQA流程生成高质量的实例接地否定数据；2) NegToMe文本token合并模块，通过将否定词与属性词合并为单个语义短语来保持正确的极性，并结合参数高效的LoRA微调方法。

Result: 该方法在挑战性否定基准测试中显著提升性能，将NMS-AP在OVDEval上提升了+10.8个点，降低了假阳性率，并能泛化到最先进的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决真实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题上迈出了关键一步，为视觉语言模型的否定理解能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互机制在单个模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、折线、线段），克服了现有方法需要为不同结构使用单独模型的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法通常针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用单独模型，这源于将实例属性（类别、结构）和几何属性（点坐标、连接）独立处理，限制了捕获复杂结构的能力。

Method: UniVector将矢量编码为包含实例和几何层次信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块迭代更新进行跨层次上下文交换，并使用动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 实验表明UniVector在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互框架成功实现了多种矢量类型的提取，为矢量提取领域提供了更通用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

TL;DR: EPIPTrack是一个统一的多模态视觉语言跟踪框架，通过显式和隐式提示进行动态目标建模和语义对齐，在多个跟踪数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉，需要更动态的多模态跟踪方法。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述提供时空指导，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，并通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整。设计了判别性特征增强器来增强视觉和跨模态表示。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器，展现出强大的适应性和优越性能。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack通过动态的多模态提示机制成功解决了现有跟踪方法在实时适应性和语义对齐方面的局限性，为多目标跟踪提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)和相应的防御策略。EDPA是一种模型无关的攻击方法，通过破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐来干扰VLA模型，导致机器人任务失败。同时提出了对抗性微调防御方案来缓解这种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习中取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究VLA模型的对抗脆弱性并提出相应的防御方法。

Method: 提出了嵌入破坏补丁攻击(EDPA)，这是一种模型无关的对抗攻击方法，通过优化两个目标来生成对抗补丁：(1)破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐；(2)最大化对抗样本和干净样本潜在表示之间的差异。同时提出了对抗性微调防御策略，优化视觉编码器使其对干净和对抗样本产生相似的潜在表示。

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准上的广泛评估表明，EDPA显著提高了最先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御方法有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了VLA模型在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，提出的EDPA攻击方法有效干扰了模型性能，同时提出的对抗性微调防御策略能够有效提升模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

Conclusion: FlyAwareV2通过其丰富的标注和环境多样性，为基于无人机的3D城市场景理解研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Result: 在SketchSem3D上的大量实验表明，CymbaDiff在语义一致性、空间真实性和跨数据集泛化方面都达到了优越性能。

Conclusion: SketchSem3D基准数据集和CymbaDiff方法为户外3D语义场景生成提供了标准化评估框架，并显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有的人群计数方法在嵌入式系统实际应用中存在模型参数过多、计算复杂等问题，而嵌入式系统应用要求模型具有实时性。

Method: 使用stem网络中的大卷积核扩大感受野提取头部细节信息；在编码器部分使用条件通道加权和多分支局部融合块以低计算消耗融合多尺度特征；在编码器顶部添加特征金字塔网络缓解不完全融合问题。

Conclusion: 该网络适用于嵌入式系统上的超实时人群计数，在保证竞争性准确率的同时实现了最快的推理速度。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在视频问答任务上取得进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍不清楚，需要深入探索。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，研究不同层中的跨帧交互和视频-语言整合模式。

Result: 发现时序推理在早期到中间层开始跨帧交互，中间层实现视频-语言整合，整合完成后在中间到后期层生成正确答案。通过选择有效信息路径可保持58%的注意力边被抑制时的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了VideoLLMs进行时序推理的机制，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了不同模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 提出MDM架构，使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Method: 引入MMLongCite基准，包含8个不同任务，涵盖6个上下文长度区间，整合了文本、图像和视频等多种模态。

Result: 对最先进的大型视觉语言模型的评估显示，它们在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实度有限。深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实度的影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够更有效处理长多模态上下文的模型，MMLongCite基准为评估和改进此类模型提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

### [40] [Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282)
*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT方法，通过掩码退化分类预训练实现通用图像恢复，结合退化类型分类和图像重建，显著提升CNN和Transformer在图像恢复任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中存在局限性，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型并具有强泛化能力的预训练方法。

Method: 使用编码器和两个解码器：编码器提取掩码低质量图像特征，分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重建高质量图像，结合掩码图像建模和对比学习。

Result: 在5D全能恢复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和级别表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT提供了一种有效的图像恢复预训练方法，显著提升性能并发布包含250万样本的UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at
https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中因光照变化、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率等挑战导致的文档分类困难。

Method: 四阶段流程：图像采集与预处理、DBNet++文本检测、BART文本分类、PyQt5用户界面集成。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上文本检测准确率达92.88%，能有效处理各种困难场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在无约束成像场景下对混合来源文档分类具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构因果模型的新方法，用于3D点云新类发现分割任务，通过因果表示和推理联合学习来建立基础和新型类别之间的准确关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云新类发现分割问题，旨在利用已标注的基础类别监督来分割未标注的新型类别，关键在于建立点表示与类别标签之间的精确关联。

Method: 使用结构因果模型重新形式化3D-NCD问题，提出因果表示和推理联合学习方法：分析基础类别表示中的隐藏混杂因素，设计消除混杂因素的因果表示原型，并通过图结构建模基础类别与新型类别原型之间的因果关系。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的广泛实验和可视化结果证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过引入因果约束和结构建模，能够有效发现点云中准确对应类别的本质表示，解决新类发现分割问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM方法，在保持重建精度的同时实现了比COLMAP快约40倍的速度，并能处理大规模场景（如5000张图像）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP、GLOMAP）在CPU上运行存在计算开销大、灵活性有限的问题，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）在处理大量输入视图时GPU内存消耗急剧增加。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM管线的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知的束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA和GP。

Result: 在不同规模的数据集上（包括5000张图像的大规模场景），相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的加速，同时保持了相当甚至更好的重建精度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，解决了SfM在大规模场景下的精度与速度权衡问题。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

### [44] [Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13315)
*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练自由解码策略，通过查询依赖的视觉增强和自适应阈值算法，显著减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用的视觉增强，忽视了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询与视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个令牌候选大小。

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在事实一致性方面显著优于最先进的解码方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询依赖增强和熵感知解码对于改进LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常生活中，我们所消费和看到的内容高度影响着我们。吸引和保持注意力（即视觉趣味性）至关重要。随着大型多模态模型在视觉和文本数据上的训练展现出强大能力，研究者希望探索这些模型对视觉趣味性概念的理解程度。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o（领先的大型多模态模型）预测之间的对齐程度，利用GPT-4o对图像对的趣味性进行标注，并将这些标注作为训练数据来蒸馏知识到学习排序模型中。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分对齐，GPT-4o在捕捉这一概念方面表现优于现有最先进方法，能够有效标注图像对的趣味性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为更深入理解人类兴趣铺平了道路，展示了大型多模态模型在理解视觉趣味性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的代价体积，从而显著提高推理速度并减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经验观察到代价体积在RAFT等光流估计管道的其他网络部分充分训练后会失去重要性，但代价体积的计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除代价体积，创建了三个不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，同时比可比模型快1.2倍且内存占用降低6倍；最快的模型能够在仅使用500MB GPU内存的情况下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 提出的训练策略能够有效移除光流估计器中的代价体积，在保持精度的同时显著提升速度和减少内存需求。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽武器检测成像技术存在分辨率低、隐私问题等限制，需要实时、低成本、保护隐私的解决方案，而热成像缺乏基准数据集。

Method: 基于YOLOv8构建DEF-YOLO架构，在SPPF层采用可变形卷积利用多尺度特征，在骨干网络和颈部网络提取低、中、高级特征，并引入焦点损失解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 创建了首个大规模热成像隐蔽武器数据集TICW，提出的方法在热成像隐蔽武器检测任务中建立了新的基准。

Conclusion: DEF-YOLO能够自适应地聚焦热均匀区域中的物体定位，在保持速度和吞吐量的同时，为热成像隐蔽武器检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE存在码本崩溃问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，限制了码本学习能力并降低了重建质量。

Method: Group-VQ进行分组优化码本，每个组独立优化，组内联合优化，改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡。同时提出训练后码本重采样方法。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验中，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现更好，训练后码本采样方法成功实现了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ通过分组优化有效解决了VQ-VAE的码本崩溃问题，提高了重建性能，同时训练后码本重采样提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无参考视频质量评估方法和数据集主要针对相机拍摄视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生偏差预测，因为渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影。

Method: 创建了一个大型渲染导向视频数据集，包含各种3D场景和渲染设置，并设计了专门针对渲染视频的NR-VQA度量方法，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性。

Result: 提出的度量方法在渲染视频上表现出优于现有NR-VQA度量的性能，并能用于基准测试超采样方法和评估实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 开发了一个专门针对渲染视频的质量评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，为计算机图形应用中的视频质量评估提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型的零样本分类中，对于高性能模型，简单提示词效果最好，增加细节反而会降低性能，这种现象称为"提示过拟合"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在零样本分类中，提示词设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）的影响，特别是在数据稀缺条件下的表现。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代视觉语言模型，采用三层次提示词设计，系统性地增加语言细节。

Result: 高性能模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP）使用最简单提示词时表现最佳，增加描述性细节会显著降低性能（MetaCLIP 2准确率从68.8%降至55.1%）；而低性能模型SigLip在模糊类别上使用基于身体线索的详细提示词时表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对视觉语言模型的零样本分类性能有重要影响，高性能模型倾向于简单提示词，而低性能模型可能受益于更详细的提示词，揭示了"提示过拟合"现象。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上性能下降，因为它们从VLM继承的空间推理能力有限，且依赖大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中定位，这降低了训练效率且仍不足以实现准确的空间理解。

Method: 采用混合transformer设计，统一整合视觉语言模型、深度transformer和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成端到端模型，显式地通过预训练深度预测模块融入空间感知。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式整合空间感知能力，有效提升了VLA模型的空间推理性能，在多种环境中都表现出色，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的动态城市场景建模方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了应用范围。本文探索如何通过2D对象无关先验（深度和点跟踪）结合SDF表示来放松这些要求。

Method: 将SDF与3DGS集成，利用两种方法的优势创建更鲁棒的对象表示。采用统一优化框架，增强3D高斯泼溅的几何精度，改进SDF内的变形建模。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合SDF和3DGS，在减少数据需求的同时实现了高质量的动态场景渲染和重建，为场景编辑提供了更多可能性。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Yu-Tong Guo,Tianyue Zheng,Jinyang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和语义感知软监督，在保持轻量化的同时提升跨域识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有WiFi手势识别方法因CSI的领域敏感性和缺乏高层手势抽象而导致的泛化能力有限和语义表达能力不足的问题。

Method: 设计双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式，使用多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入并通过跨模态注意力对齐手势语义，引入语义感知软监督方案编码类间相关性，开发鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务中均优于现有最先进方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实世界AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的基准Spatial-DISE，基于认知分类法评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，特别关注内在动态空间推理。通过自动化流水线生成数据集，评估28个先进VLM发现与人类能力存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准不足以评估空间推理能力，特别是人类空间认知的基本方面——内在动态空间推理。需要更全面的评估框架来推动VLM在机器人、增强现实等领域的应用。

Method: 基于认知分类法将任务分为四个基本象限：内在静态、内在动态、外在静态、外在动态空间推理。开发可扩展的自动化流水线生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题。

Result: 创建了Spatial-DISE数据集（559个评估VQA对和12K+训练VQA对）。评估28个先进VLM发现，当前模型在多步骤多视图空间推理上与人类能力存在显著且一致的差距。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健的框架、有价值的数据集和明确方向，旨在实现类人空间智能。基准、数据集和代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mask-GRPO方法，首次将GRPO强化学习应用于被忽视的掩码生成模型范式，通过重新定义转移概率和将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，显著提升了文本到图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，而忽略了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案。

Method: 提出Mask-GRPO方法，重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，并采用去除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等策略。

Result: 在标准T2I基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著提升了基础模型Show-o的性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将GRPO强化学习应用于掩码生成模型，为该范式提供了有效的训练方法，在文本到图像生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，通过两阶段适配器架构实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于较低分辨率，无法有效处理4K+高分辨率图像修复中的内容一致性和提示对齐挑战，特别是在纹理复杂度增加时。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器在降低分辨率下学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器通过补丁级注意力机制实现全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 实验表明Patch-Adapter不仅解决了大规模修复中常见的伪影问题，还在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距，为4K+分辨率文本引导图像修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoDS方法解决自动驾驶中异构场景下的协作感知问题，通过轻量级空间通道调整器和域分离分布对齐来有效处理特征差异，在保证检测精度的同时提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，不适用于实际异构场景。现有方法将邻居特征对齐到自车特征，容易受域间隙噪声影响且效率低下。

Method: 使用轻量级空间通道调整器(LSCR)进行空间和通道维度特征对齐，通过域分离分布对齐(DADS)模块分离域相关和任务相关信息，结合域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失增强特征对齐效果。

Result: CoDS有效缓解异构场景下的特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得良好平衡，采用全卷积架构确保高效推理。

Conclusion: CoDS方法成功解决了异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，实现了精度与效率的平衡，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离对物理场景属性的选择性。需要一种方法来表征神经元对这些可解释物理因素的选择性。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，参数化网格变形为径向基函数，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何规则性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探测神经元对可解释3D因素（如姿态和光照）的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学连接起来，提供了一种超越传统基于像素方法的、基于物理的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像技术在食品质量分析中的有效应用，比较不同建模方法的性能，特别是CNN和PLS在处理空间和光谱信息方面的差异。

Method: 通过四项研究验证五个研究假设，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）和偏最小二乘法（PLS）进行建模比较，包括2D CNN增强光谱卷积层的方法。

Result: CNN的联合空间-光谱分析在化学和物理视觉信息相关参数建模中表现最佳；增强光谱卷积层的2D CNN能改善预测性能；PLS在分析化学参数平均含量时表现相当；CNN能生成更合理的化学分布图。

Conclusion: 近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中具有潜力，CNN在空间分布建模方面优于PLS，但需要解决参考值获取的挑战，同时开发了高效的建模工具包。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Motivation: 结合现代潜在文本到视频模型和3D重建系统的优势，创建一个强大的3D场景生成器。

Method: 使用模型拼接技术连接文本到视频生成器和3D解码器，并通过直接奖励微调进行对齐，确保生成的潜在表示能够解码为一致的3D几何。

Result: 与现有文本到3D模型相比，所有测试组合都显著改进，能够生成高质量的高斯泼溅和点云图。

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功地将文本到视频生成与3D重建相结合，为文本到3D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Conclusion: 动作单元是有效的非瞬态特征，能够很好地支持复杂情绪的增量学习，避免灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

Result: 重建质量显著优于全局隐式模型(iRBSM)，误差小于2毫米，处理时间少于6分钟，提供更详细的表面重建。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高质量、低成本、完全开源的3D乳房几何重建，为医疗应用提供了可访问的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

### [66] [Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546)
*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了GPU和FPGA在视觉SLAM中加速特征检测的性能，发现对于传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris），GPU实现更优；而对于学习型检测器（SuperPoint），FPGA实现具有更好的运行时性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中耗时的模块，而现代SoC平台集成了GPU和FPGA两种硬件加速器，需要比较它们在视觉SLAM中的实际性能表现。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal等现代SoC平台上，比较GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在视觉SLAM流水线中的性能。

Result: 传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris）的GPU实现比FPGA实现具有更好的运行时性能和能效；而学习型检测器SuperPoint的FPGA实现比GPU实现性能提升3.1倍，能效提升1.4倍。GPU加速的V-SLAM在精度上普遍优于FPGA加速版本。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测能有效提升V-SLAM性能，传统检测器适合GPU加速，学习型检测器更适合FPGA加速，且硬件加速可减少全局束调整调用频率而不损失精度。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于代理的流式基准测试，研究跨文化组成和渐进模糊化如何影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要应对文化差异和视觉条件退化。

Method: 使用基于CLIP特征空间的代理模型，在5x5格子上移动交互，环境提供sigma调度的Gaussian模糊输入。比较单一文化群体和混合群体的表现。

Result: 发现文化群体间存在不对称退化曲线：亚洲群体在低模糊时表现更好但中间阶段下降更快，西方群体退化更均匀。混合群体呈现中间模式。

Conclusion: 文化组成和交互结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Motivation: 深度估计对自动驾驶至关重要，雷达-相机融合在恶劣条件下通过提供互补几何线索来增强鲁棒性。

Method: 提出轻量化架构XD-RCDepth，引入两种知识蒸馏策略：可解释性对齐蒸馏（传递教师网络的显著性结构给学生）和深度分布蒸馏（将深度回归重构为离散化区间的软分类）。

Result: 相比直接训练，MAE降低7.97%，在nuScenes和ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上实现竞争性精度和实时效率。

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth在保持可比精度的同时显著减少参数，通过知识蒸馏策略有效缓解压缩带来的性能损失，为自动驾驶提供高效的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AVAR-Net，一种轻量级音频-视觉异常识别框架，通过融合音频和视觉特征来提升在遮挡、低光照等挑战性条件下的识别性能，并引入了新的VAAR数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常识别方法主要依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照、恶劣天气等条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音频-视觉数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: AVAR-Net包含四个模块：音频特征提取器（Wav2Vec2）、视频特征提取器（MobileViT）、早期融合机制和多阶段时序卷积网络（MTCN），用于建模跨模态关系和长期时序依赖。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最优方法提升2.8%平均精度。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net展示了在多模态异常识别中的有效性、高效性和泛化能力，VAAR数据集为推进多模态异常识别研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了医学图像增强领域的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标，基于39篇同行评审研究，发现低对比度和噪声是最常见问题，MRI和多模态成像研究最多，而组织病理学、内窥镜和骨闪烁扫描等专业模态研究不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像质量对早期检测、准确诊断和有效治疗规划至关重要，但现有图像常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等问题影响，限制了诊断潜力。需要强大的预处理、去噪算法和先进的增强方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法的系统文献综述，分析了39篇同行评审研究，涵盖不同成像模态和增强方法，包括传统数学方法、深度学习技术和混合方法。

Result: 在39项研究中，29项使用传统数学方法，9项关注深度学习技术，1项探索混合方法。在图像质量评估方面，18项研究同时使用参考和非参考指标，9项仅使用参考指标，12项仅使用非参考指标，共引入了65个IQA指标，主要为非参考指标。

Conclusion: 该综述强调了当前医学图像增强领域的局限性、研究空白和未来发展方向，指出需要更多关注专业成像模态的研究，并改进评估指标以更好地反映临床价值。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器的对抗攻击脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击检测和不确定性估计的基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DINOv2的异常检测器在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性和异常分数的校准不确定性尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其在安全关键应用中的可信部署。

Method: 在AnomalyDINO基础上，通过添加轻量级线性头来生成白盒梯度攻击，同时使用Platt缩放对异常分数进行后处理校准。

Result: 研究发现微小扰动可导致特征空间中最近邻关系翻转，造成误分类；原始异常分数校准较差；校准后验在对抗样本上具有更高预测熵，可有效检测攻击。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性和不确定性量化是异常检测系统可信部署的必备能力，研究为基于DINOv2的异常检测器建立了评估协议和基准。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Result: 在多个超分辨率基准测试中表现出色，能够生成高保真度、感知准确的图像重建结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有方法在处理退化图像时的局限性，实现了结构一致的高质量图像生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑管道提供了一个可扩展且通用的范例。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法难以泛化到不同数据领域，主要原因是标注数据集稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标签面部图像集，采用伪标签策略并设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和多模态大语言模型的语义线索计算置信度分数。

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅是一个有效的视线估计方法，还可作为可扩展的数据引擎，具有强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的局限性，实现了更高效、更高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

TL;DR: 提出KnowCoL框架，结合图像和文本描述到共享语义空间，利用Wikidata结构化信息进行开放域视觉实体识别，在OVEN基准上显著提升未见实体的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集、有限监督、高视觉模糊性和语义消歧等挑战，需要处理训练时未见的长尾分布实体。

Method: 使用知识引导的对比学习框架，将视觉和文本输入抽象到概念层面，利用实体描述、类型层次和关系上下文来支持零样本实体识别。

Result: 在OVEN基准上，最小模型相比最先进方法将未见实体的准确率提升了10.5%，且模型尺寸小35倍。

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提高开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是对稀有和未见实体，证明了知识引导方法的有效性。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个生成式模型，能够从单张图像或文本提示在几秒内生成3D场景，速度比先前工作快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图导向方法生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，而3D导向方法直接生成3D高斯表示但视觉质量较差。作者希望结合两种范式的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持MV导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型，然后通过跨模式后训练蒸馏，将3D导向模式的分布匹配到高质量MV导向模式。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持3D一致性的同时显著提升视觉质量，并减少推理所需的去噪步骤，实现了快速高质量的3D场景生成。

Conclusion: FlashWorld成功整合了MV导向和3D导向范式的优势，实现了快速、高质量且具有良好泛化能力的3D场景生成。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Marina Crespo Aguirre,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs）的新方法，用于从病理图像生成健康的反事实图像，在保留个体解剖特征的同时选择性去除病理区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中生成健康的反事实图像对于异常检测和健康扫描分析工具的应用具有重要意义。现有方法难以在有效去除异常和保留个体特征之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始条件，还以对应的合成病理图像为最终条件，将病理图像作为结构信息先验来指导生成过程。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务中优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM方法能够生成更准确匹配患者解剖结构的健康反事实图像，同时有效去除病理区域，在医学影像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS)方法，通过重构查询增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，实现查询级风险评估，并自适应引导激活以生成安全且有用的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型在处理多模态查询时面临安全挑战，现有方法要么需要昂贵的训练成本，要么在推理时存在过度拒绝良性查询和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 重构查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，进行查询级风险评估，并基于风险评估自适应引导激活生成响应。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试中，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在保证安全性的同时提升了模型效用和推理效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MVCustom框架，解决多视角生成与个性化定制的统一问题，通过特征场表示和深度感知特征渲染等技术实现几何一致性和定制保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时实现多视角相机姿态控制和个性化定制，多视角生成模型缺乏几何一致性，而定制模型缺乏显式视角控制。

Method: 使用特征场表示学习主体身份和几何，结合增强的文本到视频扩散主干，在推理阶段引入深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全技术。

Result: MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和定制的框架，在实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: MVCustom成功解决了多视角定制任务，实现了多视角一致性和定制保真度的统一。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于学习的方法，从脑Willis环（CoW）的医学图像中提取中心线图和形态特征，结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接算法，在TopCoW数据集上实现了高精度的解剖结构重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是脑部重要动脉网络，与脑血管疾病密切相关。传统骨架化方法难以可靠提取其复杂几何结构的中心线，且公开可用的中心线数据集稀缺。

Method: 使用细化骨架化算法从TopCoW数据集（200名卒中患者的MRA和CTA图像）提取中心线图，开发基线算法结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接。

Result: 算法在测试集上实现高精度拓扑重建（F1=1），平均欧几里得节点距离小于1体素。半径、长度和分叉比等特征稳健，中位相对误差低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接能实现解剖学合理的中心线提取，强调了超越简单体素测量的重要性。数据集和基线算法已公开以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集局限于单相机设置且缺乏外部真值，无法满足多相机光场配准方法的严格评估需求。

Method: 提供了两种互补的配准方法：基于RANSAC的跨视图点云3D变换估计，以及从单光场图像估计6自由度外参位姿的光场PnP算法。两种方法都明确集成了光场相机模型。

Result: 实验显示与地面真值有很强的对齐性，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集和配准方法为多相机光场配准提供了可靠的评估基准，实现了准确且可扩展的多相机配准。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种循环自监督扩散框架(CSS-Diff)，用于从真实低场MRI数据合成高质量的高场MRI图像，通过循环一致性约束确保解剖结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI虽然更便宜、更易获取且更安全，但存在分辨率低和信噪比差的问题。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度并增强细粒度结构细节。

Method: 采用循环自监督扩散框架，核心思想是在循环一致性约束下重新构建基于扩散的合成。包含两个新过程：切片间间隙感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性；局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建增强局部特征恢复。

Result: 在跨场合成任务中达到最先进性能：PSNR 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM 0.943±0.102，LPIPS 0.0864±0.0689。相比原始低场MRI，左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层误差从4.2%降至3.7%。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在定量上可靠且在解剖学上一致的图像，有效解决了低场MRI到高场MRI合成的临床保真度问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

TL;DR: 提出LogViG，一种结合CNN和GNN的混合模型，使用新的对数可扩展图构建方法(LSGC)来增强视觉图神经网络性能，在图像分类和语义分割任务上超越了现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉图神经网络(ViG)在图构建方法上存在不足，如KNN方法在大图像上计算昂贵，SVGA的固定步长尺度会导致过度压缩和缺失长距离连接。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法限制长距离连接数量，并构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，引入高分辨率分支和多尺度特征融合。

Result: 最小的Ti-LogViG模型在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%的平均top-1准确率，比Vision GNN高1.7%，参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC在ViG中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法要么只能生成高质量的单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。需要一种统一的方法来同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 采用统一的扩散框架，联合训练识别和生成任务。使用非对称噪声和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上进行训练。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有优越的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力也更强。框架成功扩展到其他古代文字，包括甲骨文和埃及象形文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli通过识别和生成任务的协同训练，实现了概念级抽象，在有限数据情况下显著提升了两个任务的性能，为书法计算复制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex

speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分，OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7和4.3分，优于现有并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推进了生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展测试时优化，向更可信可控的下一代推理系统迈进。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

*Junhong Shen,Mu Cai,Bo Hu,Ameet Talwalkar,David A Ross,Cordelia Schmid,Alireza Fathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RECODE是一个代理框架，通过将视觉内容逆向工程为可执行代码来实现可验证的视觉推理，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在图表和几何图形等结构化视觉内容上的推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理图表、图表等结构化视觉内容时缺乏验证机制，像素级感知难以进行精确推理。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用批评器选择最忠实的重建结果，并迭代优化代码，将模糊的感知任务转化为可验证的符号问题。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA和Geometry3K等多个视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅将代码用于绘制辅助线或裁剪的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为实现更准确、可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-MMMU是一个综合性的多模态基准测试，通过八个推理密集型领域系统性地评估视觉理解和生成能力的双向协同作用，填补了现有基准测试的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试要么孤立地评估视觉理解和生成能力，要么忽略了这两种能力内在耦合的任务，无法真正检验统一多模态模型的集成能力。

Method: 设计了包含科学、编程、数学和谜题等八个领域的双向耦合任务，要求模型要么利用概念理解指导精确的视觉合成，要么利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架，并包含可验证的中间推理步骤和独特的真实答案。

Result: 通过对最先进的统一模型、纯生成模型和纯理解模型的广泛评估，发现了显著的性能差异和跨模态依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为理解视觉理解和生成能力何时以及如何相互增强提供了新见解，并为推进统一模型的发展建立了可靠基础。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

Motivation: 弥合fMRI与自然图像之间的模态差异，为fMRI数据构建基础模型。

Method: 将4D fMRI体积数据转换为2D活动平铺图视频，使用时空掩码自编码器框架训练Vision Transformers。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集大小按严格幂律提升，下游分类显示模型学习到丰富表征，支持跨被试状态解码和跨状态特质解码。

Conclusion: 成功构建了fMRI基础模型，验证了数据规模对性能的重要性，为fMRI数据分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVC是一个用于故事续写的扩散模型框架，通过CLIP检索最相关的历史图像，并在没有足够相关图像时自适应限制先前视觉信息的影响，同时使用LLM重新标注数据集来提升数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事续写中如何有效利用先前视觉上下文，同时确保与当前文本输入的语义对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索语义最相关的历史图像，当没有足够相关图像时，自适应限制先前视觉信息在扩散过程中的影响；使用大语言模型重新标注噪声数据集以加强文本监督。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估表明，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性案例中表现更佳。

Conclusion: AVC框架能够有效利用视觉上下文，同时避免误导或不相关信息的影响，在故事续写任务中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

*Nir Goren,Oren Katzir,Abhinav Nakarmi,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif,Or Patashnik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级水印方案NoisePrints，利用扩散过程的随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要，特别是当模型所有者保持模型私有且无法处理作者身份问题时，需要第三方验证方案。

Method: 利用扩散过程初始化使用的随机种子作为水印，通过哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，确保无法从内容中恢复有效种子或找到替代种子通过验证。

Result: 在多个最先进的图像和视频扩散模型上验证了NoisePrints的有效性，仅需种子和输出即可高效验证，无需模型权重。

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的水印方案，通过密码学零知识证明保护种子隐私，提高了水印移除的难度。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

TL;DR: 提出了Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据清理流程，训练出的Bee-8B模型在完全开源MLLM中达到新SOTA，性能可与半开源模型竞争


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前完全开源的多模态大语言模型落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距，现有开源数据集存在广泛噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据

Method: 1) 引入Honey-Data-15M数据集，包含约1500万QA对，经过多重清理技术处理并采用新颖的双层(短和长)CoT增强策略；2) 开发HoneyPipe数据整理流水线和DataStudio框架；3) 训练Bee-8B模型进行验证

Result: Bee-8B在完全开源MLLM中建立了新的SOTA，性能与InternVL3.5-8B等半开源模型竞争，在某些情况下甚至超越

Conclusion: 专注于数据质量是开发具有竞争力的完全开源MLLM的关键途径，为社区提供了数据集、工具链、训练配方和模型权重等基础资源

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner模型，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的3D表示，实现无需外部模块的自回归3D视觉定位，并显著提升空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 采用双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示，不增加输入token数量。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得显著成果，无需外部模块即可实现自回归定位，性能与最先进模型相当，并显著提升了空间推理能力。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，通过GCoT数据集进一步桥接了定位与空间推理，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field表示方法，将视频表示为每个像素的连续3D轨迹，并开发Trace Anything神经网络单次前向预测整个轨迹场，在轨迹估计任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的像素在时间维度上形成连续3D轨迹，是动态的基本单元，需要有效的时空表示来建模和理解视频动态。

Method: 将视频表示为轨迹场，每个像素对应一个连续3D轨迹函数；使用Trace Anything神经网络单次前向预测每个像素的B样条控制点参数化轨迹。

Result: 在新轨迹场估计基准上达到SOTA性能，在已有点跟踪基准上表现竞争力；显著效率提升；展现目标条件操作、运动预测等涌现能力。

Conclusion: 轨迹场表示和Trace Anything模型为视频动态建模提供了有效解决方案，在性能、效率和功能多样性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域自适应方法在微调不同VLM组件时，往往导致有限的领域特定特征学习或灾难性遗忘先前能力，需要一种更有效的适应策略。

Method: 提出Vision Contextualized Probing (VisCoP)，通过向VLM的视觉编码器添加紧凑的可学习视觉探针集合，实现高效领域特定自适应。

Result: 在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务三个挑战性领域自适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有适应策略，在目标领域获得优越性能同时有效保留源领域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP提供了一种高效的大视觉语言模型领域自适应方法，通过最小化对预训练参数的修改实现优越的跨领域性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

TL;DR: PhysMaster通过物理表征学习和强化学习来提升视频生成模型的物理感知能力，使其生成更符合物理规律的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉上真实的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力。需要提升模型的物理感知能力。

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件；应用基于人类反馈的强化学习，使用DPO方法端到端优化物理表征。

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其能力，并能泛化到广泛的物理场景，为物理感知视频生成提供了可行解决方案。

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习统一了各种物理过程的解决方案，可作为通用的即插即用方案用于物理感知视频生成和更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种语言中表现出色，但其在波斯语等低资源语言中的有效性需要深入研究，以填补多语言LLM研究中的空白。

Method: 使用ParsiNLU和ArmanEmo等波斯语数据集，在情感分析、命名实体识别、阅读理解、问答等任务中评估多个开源LLM，采用零样本和少样本学习范式，使用准确率、F1分数、BLEU和ROUGE等指标进行评估。

Result: Gemma 2在几乎所有任务和两种学习范式中都表现最佳，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出；但大多数模型在命名实体识别等标记级理解任务上表现不佳，揭示了波斯语处理中的特定挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言大语言模型研究提供了波斯语性能的宝贵见解，并为未来模型开发提供了基准，强调了在低资源语言中LLM性能评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like
Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We
evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using
established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology
encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for
performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently
outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms,
with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most
models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity
Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing.
This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs,
providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a
benchmark for future model development.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了5种大语言模型在电子健康记录中癌症诊断分类的性能，发现BioBERT在结构化ICD代码分类中表现最佳，而GPT-4o在自由文本诊断分类中表现最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含不一致的结构化或自由文本数据，需要高效预处理来支持预测性医疗模型。AI驱动的自然语言处理工具在自动化诊断分类方面显示出潜力，但其比较性能和临床可靠性需要系统评估。

Method: 评估了4种大语言模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2、Gemini 1.5）和BioBERT在从结构化和非结构化电子健康记录数据中分类癌症诊断的性能。分析了3456名癌症患者的762个独特诊断（326个ICD代码描述，436个自由文本条目），将诊断分类到14个预定义类别中，并由两位肿瘤学专家验证分类结果。

Result: BioBERT在ICD代码分类中获得最高加权宏F1分数（84.2），在ICD代码准确率上与GPT-4o持平（90.8）。对于自由文本诊断，GPT-4o在加权宏F1分数（71.8 vs 61.5）和准确率（81.9 vs 81.6）上均优于BioBERT。GPT-3.5、Gemini和Llama在两种格式上的整体表现较低。常见错误分类模式包括转移瘤与中枢神经系统肿瘤之间的混淆，以及涉及模糊或重叠临床术语的错误。

Conclusion: 虽然当前性能水平对于行政和研究用途似乎足够，但可靠的临床应用将需要标准化的文档实践以及针对高风险决策的稳健人工监督。

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估前沿大语言模型在战略欺骗方面的能力，通过博弈论框架测试发现即使没有明确提示，模型也表现出显著的欺骗倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型代理在多样化环境中自主部署，评估其战略欺骗能力变得至关重要，而LLM之间的欺骗行为研究尚不充分。

Method: 使用两种博弈论框架：廉价谈话信号博弈和同行评估对抗博弈，测试四个前沿模型，分析有提示和无提示情况下的欺骗表现和策略。

Result: 当有提示时，大多数模型（特别是Gemini-2.5-pro和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）达到接近完美的表现；无提示时所有模型在同行评估中都选择欺骗而非坦白（100%），在廉价谈话中选择欺骗的模型成功率达到95-100%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在多智能体环境中使用高风险博弈论场景进行稳健评估的必要性。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse
contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial.
While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human
developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the
scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two
game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation
adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and
without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through
chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially
Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance.
Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting:
all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate),
while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These
findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes
game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

### [103] [From Noise to Signal to Selbstzweck: Reframing Human Label Variation in the Era of Post-training in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12817)
*Shanshan Xu,Santosh T. Y. S. S,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张在AI系统设计中应将人类标签变异(HLV)作为自身目标来保护，呼吁在偏好数据集中主动纳入HLV以体现人类价值观的多元性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习数据集将多个标注聚合成单一标签，抹杀了人类视角的多样性，这与AI对齐旨在保护人类多元价值观的目标相矛盾。

Method: 提出在偏好数据集中主动保留HLV的具体可行步骤，将其作为系统设计的重要原则。

Result: 通过理论分析和立场阐述，强调了HLV在LLM时代的重要性，指出当前做法存在的问题。

Conclusion: HLV应被视为体现人类多元主义的载体，在AI系统设计中必须作为自身目标来保护，而非被当作噪声消除。

Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation
that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere
error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only
slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving
model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where
post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role
of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning
datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby
flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing
precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In
this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human
pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI
systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and
outline actionable steps towards it.

*Rajarshi Ghosh,Abhay Gupta,Hudson McBride,Anurag Vaidya,Faisal Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDEQUALQA是一个用于评估医疗AI中大型语言模型推理稳定性的基准测试，通过仅改变患者代词来检测临床决策中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床决策支持中应用日益广泛，但细微的人口统计线索可能影响其推理过程。现有研究记录了不同患者群体间的输出差异，但对受控人口统计变化下内部推理如何变化了解甚少。

Method: 引入MEDEQUALQA反事实基准，仅改变患者代词（他/她/他们）而保持关键症状和条件不变。每个临床案例扩展为单症状消融，产生三个平行数据集（总计约69,000项）。使用GPT-4.1模型并计算语义文本相似性来评估推理稳定性。

Result: 结果显示总体相似性高（平均STS>0.80），但在引用的风险因素、指南依据和鉴别诊断排序方面存在一致的局部差异，即使最终诊断保持不变。错误分析突出了推理发生变化的特定案例。

Conclusion: MEDEQUALQA为审计医疗AI推理稳定性提供了一个受控诊断环境，揭示了可能级联导致不公平护理的临床相关偏见位点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision
support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work
has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is
known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes.
We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient
pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and
conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC
ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each
(69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun
variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal
consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and
differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error
analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring
clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care.
MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning
stability in medical AI.

*Thomas Gschwind,Shramona Chakraborty,Nitin Gupta,Sameep Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言描述转换为可执行ETL工作流的系统，采用分类器增强生成方法，自动预测工作流结构和详细配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ETL工具配置复杂耗时，需要专业知识，希望通过自然语言简化工作流创建过程。

Method: 使用分类器增强生成方法，结合话语分解、分类器和阶段特定少样本提示，预测阶段并连接成非线性工作流，从子话语上下文推断阶段属性。

Result: 相比单一提示和代理基线方法，在准确性和效率上都有提升，同时显著减少令牌使用量。

Conclusion: 该系统是首个在自然语言驱动ETL创作中，对阶段预测、边布局和属性生成进行全面评估的系统，具有模块化、可解释性和端到端工作流生成能力。

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

TL;DR: ChatGPT使用多实例协作协议成功解决了2025年IMO五道题和三分之一数论猜想，并通过Lean证明助手和人工验证确保证明正确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型在定理证明方面的能力，特别是在解决国际数学奥林匹克竞赛难题和数论猜想方面的表现

Method: 采用多实例协作协议，让不同的GPT-5模型实例作为证明者和验证者协同工作，最终通过Lean证明助手进行形式化验证，并由人工确认前提和结论的一致性

Result: 成功解决了2025年IMO六道题中的五道，并完成了[Cohen, 2025]中66个数论猜想的三分之一

Conclusion: 大型语言模型通过协作协议和形式化验证能够有效解决复杂的数学定理证明问题，展示了其在数学推理方面的潜力

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,
2025].

*Taicheng Guo,Hai Wang,ChaoChun Liu,Mohsen Golalikhani,Xin Chen,Xiangliang Zhang,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTSQL-R1是一个基于智能体训练的多轮Text-to-SQL框架，通过执行反馈和对话记忆验证，采用迭代的提出-执行-验证-优化循环来提高查询质量和对话连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将多轮Text-to-SQL视为简单的文本翻译任务，采用短视范式，导致生成不可执行或不连贯的SQL查询。

Method: 将任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程，智能体与数据库交互获取执行反馈，与持久对话记忆交互进行连贯性验证，执行迭代的提出-执行-验证-优化循环。

Result: 在COSQL和SPARC数据集上的实验表明，MTSQL-R1持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 环境驱动的验证和记忆引导的优化对于对话式语义解析至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨如何将现有标注指南重新用于指导大语言模型进行文本标注任务，提出了一种基于LLM调节的指南重构方法，并在NCBI疾病语料库上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注指南是为人类标注者设计的，而大语言模型需要明确、结构化的指令。为了支持可扩展且经济高效的标注指南精炼和自动化标注，需要研究如何将现有指南重新用于指导LLM标注器。

Method: 提出了一种面向调节的指南重构方法，通过LLM调节过程将传统指南转化为对LLM清晰明确的指令。使用NCBI疾病语料库作为案例研究进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明重构后的指南能够有效指导LLM标注器，同时揭示了若干实际挑战。该方法展示了支持可扩展和成本效益标注指南精炼及自动化标注的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过LLM调节过程重构现有标注指南是可行的，能够为LLM标注器提供有效指导，为自动化标注工作流程提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed
to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks.
Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize
training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a
moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines
into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the
NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed
guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several
practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to
support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and
automated annotation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了自适应代理基础模型(A²FM)，通过路由-对齐原则统一推理型和代理型LLM，引入即时模式处理简单查询，显著提升成本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理型LLM无法调用外部工具与代理型LLM推理能力不足的割裂问题，避免在简单查询上过度推理或过度调用工具的低效行为

Method: 采用路由-对齐原则：先学习任务感知路由，然后在共享骨干网络下对齐模式特定轨迹；引入即时模式处理简单查询；提出自适应策略优化(APO)进行多模式自适应采样和成本正则化奖励

Result: 在32B规模上，BrowseComp达13.4%、AIME25达70.4%、HLE达16.7%，创可比模型新SOTA；自适应执行每正确答案成本仅$0.00487，相比推理模式降低45.2%，相比代理模式降低33.5%

Conclusion: A²FM统一框架在保持准确性的同时显著提升成本效率，为LLM的推理和工具使用能力提供了高效统一的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which
strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external
tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage
tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally
different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency
on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In
this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM),
a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first
learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a
shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third
mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary
reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To
jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy
Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a
cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves
13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA
among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across
agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution
achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by
45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering
substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM长文本生成事实性的方法存在效率低（复杂流水线不适用于长输出）和效果差（声明集不准确、证据收集不足）的问题。

Method: 使用分块级声明提取结合置信度预验证，收集文档级证据并在验证时选择性检索，减少网络搜索和推理调用成本。

Result: 在聚合和人工标注的基准测试中，FastFact在效率和效果上都实现了与人类评估最高的一致性。

Conclusion: FastFact是一个快速且强大的评估框架，能有效评估长文本LLM生成的事实性，代码和基准数据已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models
(LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment.
Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for
evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1)
inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM
outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and
insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation
framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and
efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim
extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly
reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring
reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level
evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during
verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous
pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark
demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively
evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data
is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为VLURes的多语言基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在四种语言（英语、日语、斯瓦希里语、乌尔都语）下的细粒度视觉和语言理解能力，包含8个视觉语言任务和1个无关性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估主要局限于英语为中心的基准测试，且多为短文本。需要开发多语言、长文本设置下的评估基准来全面评估模型的细粒度能力。

Method: 从目标语言的网络资源中收集数据集，涵盖10种不同的图像类别和丰富的文本上下文。通过提示VLMs生成响应和推理，进行自动评估和母语者评估。

Result: 评估了10个VLMs，表现最好的GPT-4o模型总体准确率为90.8%，比人类表现低6.7%。开源模型与人类表现的差距更大。

Conclusion: VLURes基准测试在开发能够处理多模态视觉推理的智能代理方面发挥着关键作用，揭示了不同语言和任务之间的性能差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

TL;DR: EAT框架将三种自适应效率技术（渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力、动态提前退出）统一到单一可复现架构中，用于输入自适应推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个开源基准测试框架，统一多种自适应效率技术，为社区提供研究自适应transformer的工具。

Method: 结合渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态提前退出三种技术，构建端到端可复现的基准测试流水线，在GLUE任务上进行自动化评估。

Result: 在浅层六层模型中组合这些机制可能增加延迟，但在SST-2任务上比优化的DistilBERT基线获得稍高准确率，展示了动态计算在延迟敏感NLP中的潜力。

Conclusion: 主要贡献是提供了一个开放、端到端可复现的框架，包含脚本、CSV日志和分析工具，旨在作为社区进一步研究自适应transformer的工具。

Abstract: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive
efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and
dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for
input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline
that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2,
QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms
can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT
achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on
SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive
NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework -
complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve
as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决古兰经诵读教学面临的现代挑战，现有数字工具在普及性和教学效果方面存在不足，需要更有效的自动化评估方法。

Method: 对过去20年的学术研究、网络平台和商业应用进行全面文献分析，批判现有基于ASR的方法，提出基于规则的知识驱动计算框架。

Result: 发现现有方法存在数据依赖、人口偏见、无法提供诊断性反馈等问题，需要转向基于发音点和规则的前瞻性声学建模。

Conclusion: 未来古兰经自动评估工具应结合深度语言知识和先进音频分析的混合系统，提供稳健、公平且教学有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise
phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical
challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented
access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to
achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review
investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic
research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past
two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing
approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,
which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and
are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide
diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we
argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric
computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic
text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust
evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on
canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on
statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review
concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid
systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis,
offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that
can faithfully support learners worldwide.

Motivation: 随着LLMs被广泛认为是推进智能教育的关键技术，因其能够深入理解教学情境并提供个性化指导，构建专门的师生对话基准变得尤为重要。

Method: 构建EduDial数据集，涵盖345个核心知识点，包含34,250个对话会话，基于布鲁姆教育目标分类学和十种提问策略设计。开发EduDial-LLM 32B模型，并提出11维评估框架系统测量LLMs的教学能力。

Result: 在17个主流LLM上的实验表明，大多数模型在师生对话场景中表现不佳，而EduDial-LLM在所有指标上均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: EduDial数据集和EduDial-LLM模型为智能教育领域的师生对话提供了有效的基准和解决方案，显著提升了LLMs在教学场景中的表现。

Abstract: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs
are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent
education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts
and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated
teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this
end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue
dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250
dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student
agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and
incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning,
zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive
questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions.
Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at
different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance.
Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and
propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the
teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and
content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models
struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM
achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all
metrics. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了LLM对查询角色（用户身份、专长、信念等属性）的鲁棒性，发现用户角色提示会显著影响问答准确性并触发多种失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在回答事实性问题时对用户上下文（如个人身份、专长、信念等）的敏感性，确保模型基于客观知识真实回答，不受用户个性化信息影响。

Method: 通过评估LLM对查询角色（用户个人属性）的鲁棒性，分析用户在实际交互中可能披露的合理角色提示对问答准确性的影响。

Result: 研究发现用户角色提示会显著改变问答准确性，触发拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等失败模式，表明模型对用户框架的敏感性会影响事实可靠性。

Conclusion: 查询角色测试是评估LLM鲁棒性的有效工具，揭示了模型对用户框架的敏感性可能损害事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes

*Angana Borah,Rada Mihalcea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了CUEST框架来评估LLMs在不同文化背景下的好奇心表现，发现LLMs在好奇心表达上更接近西方国家，并通过微调策略将人机对齐差距缩小了50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在人类互动中的作用日益重要，但好奇心这一核心驱动因素在不同文化背景下的表现尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用Yahoo! Answers多国数据集，引入CUEST评估框架，通过语言风格、话题偏好分析和社会科学构建来测量人机好奇心对齐度。

Result: 发现LLMs在好奇心表达上扁平化了跨文化多样性，更接近西方国家的表达方式；通过微调策略可将人机对齐差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 好奇心对LLMs的跨文化适应性具有重要实践价值，是未来NLP研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in
human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains
underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this
work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a
real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST
(CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures
human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference
(content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across
open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural
diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western
countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs,
narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing
its importance for future NLP research.

*Sanghyun Byun,Mohanad Odema,Jung Ick Guack,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD) 通过引入中间限定模型来改进推测解码，使用更小的草稿模型实现更高的接受率和吞吐量，在消费级GPU上达到124 tokens/秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准推测解码存在草稿模型大小与token接受率之间的权衡：较小的草稿模型生成更快但与目标模型差异更大，导致接受率降低和加速效果减弱。

Method: 在草稿模型和目标模型之间插入中间限定模型，使用分层解码策略和模糊接受标准来弥合分布差异，支持更小的草稿模型。

Result: PyramidSD相比标准推测解码实现最高1.91倍的生成速度，在RTX 4090上达到124 tokens/秒，在1B草稿模型和8B目标模型配置下仅轻微牺牲质量换取吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PyramidSD提供了一种实用的方法来提高推测解码效率，可以轻松应用于现有推理流水线。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by
using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a
larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally
limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller
draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from
the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We
introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that
inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge
the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used
for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across
models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly
smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds
on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each
stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x
generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer
GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an
8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved
throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing
speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing
inference pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次大规模评估了LLM针对特定人口特征生成个性化虚假信息的能力，发现简单的个性化策略会显著增加所有LLM的越狱成功率，并改变生成内容的语言模式和说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力的提升，人们担心其可能被滥用于大规模生成有说服力的个性化虚假信息。现有研究主要关注LLM生成虚假信息的能力，但对说服力和个性化（针对特定人口属性定制虚假信息）的研究较少。

Method: 采用红队测试方法，系统评估LLM安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性。创建了AI-TRAITS数据集，包含约160万条由8个最先进LLM生成的文本，基于324个虚假信息叙事和150个不同人物档案，涵盖4种主要语言和关键人口维度。

Result: 研究发现：1）即使使用简单的个性化策略也会显著增加所有LLM的越狱可能性；2）个性化提示会改变语言和修辞模式；3）个性化增强了LLM生成虚假信息的说服力。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了当前最先进LLM的关键漏洞，为在多语言和跨人口背景下改进安全对齐和检测策略提供了基础。

Abstract: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought
concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and
personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that
LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and
personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic
attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first
large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation
generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A
key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion
dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight
state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324
disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four
major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic
dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting
personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the
dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation
attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple
personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the
likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised
prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the
persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose
critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a
foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in
multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OPLoRA通过双面正交投影防止LoRA微调中的灾难性遗忘，保留预训练知识的关键奇异方向


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大语言模型时会产生灾难性遗忘，因为学习更新会干扰编码预训练知识的主导奇异方向

Method: 通过SVD分解冻结权重，使用投影矩阵P_L = I - U_k U_k^⊤和P_R = I - V_k V_k^⊤将LoRA更新约束在top-k奇异子空间的正交补空间中

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成任务中，OPLoRA显著减少遗忘，同时在LLaMA-2 7B和Qwen2.5 7B上保持竞争力的任务特定性能

Conclusion: 正交投影是参数高效微调中知识保留的有效机制

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language
models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere
with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained
knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically
grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided
orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA
constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the
top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R =
I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the
top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge
retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric
measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments
across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that
OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive
task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal
projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Motivation: 为了在持续学习环境中系统评估语言模型逐步获取新技能的能力，并模拟人类发展轨迹，提供细粒度的技能依赖控制。

Method: 构建了涵盖5个发展阶段（0-4）的技能图谱，生成23.4B token的合成数据集，包含段落、理解性问答、技能测试问答和指令-响应对，使用1.35亿参数transformer在独立、联合和顺序（持续）设置下训练。

Result: 展示了技能保留和迁移效率之间的权衡，通过模拟人类学习模式提供了持续学习评估的进展。

Conclusion: 通过镜像人类学习模式并提供对技能依赖的细粒度控制，这项工作推进了语言模型的持续学习评估。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL)
grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling
systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively
acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages
5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller
abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing
which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset
with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity,
comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA),
and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B
to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer,
and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under
independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in
skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns
and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances
continual learning evaluations for language models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了偏好方差（PVar）对DPO训练效果的影响，发现高PVar的提示能产生更大的梯度更新，从而更有效地训练语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高昂且效率低下，需要减少所需标注的方法。本文旨在研究偏好方差如何影响DPO训练的有效性。

Method: 通过理论分析建立DPO梯度范数的上界，证明其受提示的PVar控制。使用奖励模型生成的偏好微调LLM，并在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard基准上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，高PVar提示优于随机选择或低PVar提示。使用仅10%最高PVar提示训练的效果优于使用完整数据集。

Conclusion: 偏好方差是识别信息丰富示例以进行高效LLM对齐的重要指标，基于PVar的选择方法具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for
learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating
methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the
impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in
model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of
DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound
on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the
PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce
small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate
this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model,
evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental
results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected
prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection
method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.
Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the
UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts
with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the
full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying
informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

TL;DR: GatePro是一种无需参数的方法，通过识别最相似的专家对并引入局部竞争机制，直接提升MoE架构中的专家选择多样性，防止冗余专家同时激活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型使用MoE架构进行高效扩展，但面临功能相似专家同时被选择的问题，导致计算冗余和有效模型容量受限。现有的平衡损失方法改善了令牌分布，但未能解决根本的专家多样性问题。

Method: GatePro识别最相似的专家对，引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家共同激活，同时保持自然的专家专业化。该方法无需额外可学习参数，可在任何训练阶段热插拔部署。

Result: 综合评估显示GatePro在不同模型规模和基准测试中均有效。分析表明GatePro能够实现增强的专家多样性，使专家发展出更独特和互补的能力，避免功能冗余。

Conclusion: GatePro提供了一种实用的解决方案，通过直接促进专家选择多样性来提升MoE架构的有效性，无需额外参数且部署灵活。

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM不确定性量化提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 临床试验对医学进步至关重要，但需要包含适当和多样化的参与者。传统方法效率低下，需要自动化系统来改进临床试验资格评估流程。

Method: 使用Word2Vec词嵌入和命名实体识别提取医学概念特征，结合计数向量化和TF-IDF等传统技术，并探索加权TF-IDF词嵌入。应用随机森林和SVM进行多标签分类，评估TextRank、Luhn和GPT-3等摘要技术。

Abstract: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve
understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role
in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is
essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and
diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The
system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec)
and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with
traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF
word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths
to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random
Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility
criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are
evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with
ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This
system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment
using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Motivation: 单样本LLM预测的准确性和鲁棒性对示例选择和集成成员多样性高度敏感，需要系统研究这两方面因素对集成性能的影响。

Method: 比较两种单样本策略：基于质心的代表性示例（提出方法）和随机采样示例（基线），同时调整采样温度来控制系统多样性。

Result: 提出的方法在较高温度设置下显著优于随机选择：宏F1提升+7.6%，RMSE降低-10.5%。同时超过5样本提示方法：宏F1提升+21.1%，RMSE降低-24.0%。

Conclusion: 结合代表性示例选择和增加温度能为集成提供适当的多样性水平，突出了示例选择和受控多样性在设计有效单样本LLM集成中的实际重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range
of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions
remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble
members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example
representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling
temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared:
centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples
(baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with
higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%
(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot
prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that
combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides
the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the
practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in
designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和北非地区在当前AI评估中代表性不足，需要专门工具来评估LLMs与该地区文化价值观的对齐程度。

Method: 基于大规模人类调查构建结构化数据集，在三种视角框架（中立、个性化、第三方观察者）和两种语言模式（英语、本地语言）下评估多种模型。

Result: 发现跨语言价值偏移、推理引发文化对齐退化、概率泄漏显示隐藏偏好，以及模型将多样化国家视为单一实体等问题。

Conclusion: MENAValues提供了诊断文化错位的可扩展框架，为开发更具文化包容性的AI提供实证见解和方法工具。

Abstract: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural
alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect
to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an
underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from
large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that
captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response
distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse
models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings
(neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language
modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our
analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where
identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,
"Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their
reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse
sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden
preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic
linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse
nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for
diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and
methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

TL;DR: Mirror-SD是一种推理算法，通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理，打破推测解码中的延迟-接受率权衡，实现高接受率和低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法在增加草稿大小提升接受率时会引入额外延迟开销，限制了速度-准确性的权衡。现有方法部分降低了草稿成本，但要么降低了接受率，要么引入了限制扩展的开销。

Method: Mirror-SD从早期退出信号启动分支完整展开，与目标模型后缀并行执行，并在异构加速器（GPU和NPU）上显式映射计算以利用跨设备并行性。草稿推测目标模型的前向延续进行验证，同时目标模型推测草稿的校正路径，将推测转换为两个互补的执行流水线。还添加推测流式处理，使草稿每步发出多个令牌。

Result: 在SpecBench上，使用14B到66B参数的服务器规模模型，Mirror-SD实现了2.8倍到5.8倍的端到端加速，相比最强基线EAGLE3平均相对改进30%。

Conclusion: Mirror-SD通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理的双重策略，将推测解码推向高接受率和低开销的理想状态，在多样化任务上提供一致的端到端增益。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look
ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation:
increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional
latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods
(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade
acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror
Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the
latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from
early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly
maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit
cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the
target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths
for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution
pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,
we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This
dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative
streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high
acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to
66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving
2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative
improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

Motivation: 当前LLMs擅长生成原始顺序代码，但在图抽象代码生成方面研究较少，这对于可视化编程语言和无法访问源代码的场景很重要。

Method: 提出并评估基于JSON的图表示方法，使用自定义Python实现的Scratch构建ScratchTest基准测试来评估LLMs在图代码空间的表现。

Result: LLMs能够在单次生成中完成图抽象代码生成任务，不同表示方法会导致显著不同的准确率，表明表示方法在此任务中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 这项工作为图抽象代码生成的表示学习迈出了第一步，证明了正确图表示对LLMs生成图结构代码的重要性。

Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential
code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been
little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is
encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.
This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw
source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we
propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy
graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on
ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of
Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that
LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass
without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph
representations. We also show that different representations induce
significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of
representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the
first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code
generation.

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models
(LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in
scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or
superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge
requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in
low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models.
To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation
framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories
from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain
knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven
selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a
fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective
knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for
scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact
model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning
benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing
high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文首次从人类推理理论角度系统综述了思维链微调技术，基于六顶思考帽框架对CoT方法进行分类分析，并指出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT微调研究主要关注技术层面，缺乏从人类推理机制角度的系统性分析。鉴于CoT微调的最终目标是让LLM像人类一样推理，从认知角度研究该技术至关重要。

Method: 基于著名的六顶思考帽框架，该框架用六个隐喻帽子系统化描述常见的人类思维模式，通过这一视角对CoT微调方法进行分类和检验。

Result: 编译了现有数据集和模型性能的全面概述，并维护了一个实时GitHub仓库持续跟踪该领域的最新进展。

Conclusion: 该综述有望成为激发创新和促进这一快速发展领域进步的重要资源，为CoT微调的未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs)
with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It
leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like
reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking,
intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception,
etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial
improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.
However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical
aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human
reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to
enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique
through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first
comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory.
Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which
systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical
hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens.
Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for
future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive
overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub
repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that
continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this
survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster
progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSCD方法，通过自约束解码实现大语言模型去毒，无需参数微调，在保持生成流畅性的同时有效降低毒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码去毒方法依赖外部约束，需要额外资源且损失生成流畅性，需要更轻量高效的解决方案

Method: DSCD方法在输出生成过程中加强安全层的内部下一词分布，同时削弱幻觉和毒性层的分布

Result: 在代表性开源LLM和公共数据集上的实验验证了DSCD的有效性，在去毒和生成流畅性方面达到SOTA性能，效率优于现有方法

Conclusion: DSCD具有轻量、高兼容性和即插即用能力，是实用且可扩展的安全LLM部署解决方案

Abstract: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research
challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external
constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation
fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding
(DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning.
DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while
weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This
effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers
lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily
integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance
improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and
public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior
efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's
potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个轻量级、模型无关的预处理框架，通过细粒度安全分类和类别特定指导来防御LVLM对抗攻击，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然具备强大的多模态推理能力，但也扩大了攻击面，特别是通过将有害目标隐藏在良性提示中的对抗输入。

Method: SHIELD结合细粒度安全分类与类别特定指导，通过明确的行动（阻止、重构、转发）来防御攻击，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五个代表性LVLM上，SHIELD持续降低越狱和不遵循率，同时保持实用性，且开销极小。

Conclusion: SHIELD作为一个即插即用的实用安全补丁，适用于弱对齐和强对齐的LVLM，且易于扩展到新的攻击类型。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but
also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that
conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight,
model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety
classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block,
Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety
prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining.
Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently
lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method
is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new
attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and
strongly aligned LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，在检索增强生成(RAG)中，检索文档的格式化方式（如分隔符、结构标记等）对模型性能有显著影响，即使语义内容相同。作者提出了上下文归一化策略来标准化上下文表示，提高RAG的鲁棒性和长上下文利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG研究主要关注检索质量和提示策略，但检索文档的格式化方式（上下文格式）对性能的影响尚未充分探索。作者发现看似表面的格式选择会导致准确性和稳定性的显著变化。

Method: 设计了控制实验来研究上下文密度、分隔符样式和位置放置的影响，并基于这些发现提出了上下文归一化策略，这是一种轻量级方法，在生成前自适应地标准化上下文表示。

Result: 在受控和真实世界RAG基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提出的策略能一致地提高对顺序变化的鲁棒性，并增强长上下文的利用能力。

Conclusion: 可靠的RAG不仅依赖于检索正确的内容，还取决于内容的呈现方式。该研究为更好的长上下文推理提供了新的实证证据和实用技术。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for
extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).
While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting
strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e.,
context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial
choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can
induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content
is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled
experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional
placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance
differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization,
a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations
before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG
benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy
consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens
long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends
not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is
presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for
better long-context reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语音到语音翻译中保持韵律特征，特别是词级重音，对于传达说话者意图和情感至关重要，但现有方法在这方面存在不足。

Method: 利用LLM进行跨语言重音转换，将源语言重音转换为目标语言标签，指导可控TTS模型生成。开发自动生成对齐训练数据的流程，并使用"LLM-as-Judge"进行评估。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持重音方面显著优于基线方法，同时保持相当的翻译质量、说话者意图和自然度。

Conclusion: 强调了韵律在翻译中的重要性，为S2ST中保留副语言线索提供了有效且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that
preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis
conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language
tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we
developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and
introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach
substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining
comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work
highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective,
data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

TL;DR: 提出简化隔离核(SIK)方法，将高维密集嵌入映射为低维稀疏表示，在保持异常检测性能的同时显著降低计算和内存成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成的高维密集嵌入在文本异常检测中面临的内存需求大和计算时间长的问题。

Method: 使用简化隔离核(SIK)将高维密集嵌入映射到低维稀疏表示，通过边界聚焦特征映射保持异常特征。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验表明，SIK在检测性能上优于11种最先进的异常检测算法，同时保持计算效率和低内存成本。

Conclusion: SIK方法有效解决了高维嵌入带来的计算挑战，在文本异常检测中实现了优异的性能和效率平衡。

Abstract: Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and
anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by
leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense
embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to
substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this
challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps
high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations
while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time
complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative
boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate
that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low
memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at

TL;DR: 提出LLM引导的合成增强方法，使用大语言模型为代表性不足群体生成反事实示例，在保持标签完整性的同时减少AI系统的性能差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统中的偏见，特别是基于自然语言数据的系统，引发伦理和实践问题。传统公平方法依赖受保护属性标签，涉及准确性与公平性的权衡，且难以跨数据集泛化

Method: 使用大语言模型生成性别交换的反事实示例，通过结构化提示创建性别互换的改写句子，并进行语义相似性检查、属性验证、毒性筛选和人工抽查等质量控制

Result: 在控制数据集上评估，LGSA将性别偏见差距从7.2%降至1.9%，同时将准确率提升至99.1%。相比简单的交换增强方法（准确率95.6%，偏见差距0.7%），LGSA在保持低偏见的同时实现了更高的准确性

Conclusion: LGSA是一种有效的偏见缓解策略，能够增强子群体平衡，同时保持高任务准确性和标签保真度

Abstract: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises
ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often
leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods,
such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on
protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not
generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided
Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate
counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label
integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences
with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.
Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by
quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,
toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded
training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent
conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without
compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a
7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7
percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled
examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for
bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task
accuracy and label fidelity.

to extract bilingual parallel corpora from newspaper articles using image and

two different language combinations and demonstrate the value of this dataset
through a downstream task of machine translation and improve over the current
baseline by close to 3 BLEU points.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了分层频率标记探针(HFTP)，用于分析大语言模型和人类大脑如何处理句法结构，发现LLMs在类似层级处理句法，而人脑依赖不同皮层区域，模型升级呈现与大脑对齐度的不同趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否使用类似人脑的机制来处理句法结构，澄清LLMs行为能力的计算基础。

Method: 使用分层频率标记探针(HFTP)进行频域分析，识别LLMs中编码句法结构的神经元组件和人脑皮层区域，并进行表征相似性分析。

Result: GPT-2、Gemma、Llama等模型在类似层级处理句法，人脑依赖不同皮层区域；LLMs表征与大脑左半球更相似；模型升级趋势不同：Gemma 2比Gemma更接近大脑，Llama 3.1比Llama 2更偏离大脑。

Conclusion: HFTP是连接计算语言学和认知神经科学的有价值工具，LLMs的改进可能由非人脑机制驱动，为模型可解释性提供新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior
language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific
computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM
behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.
To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging
Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify
neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic
structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama
2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human
brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.
Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM
representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language
processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows
greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with
the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the
interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about
whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like
mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational
linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在需要抽象推理的任务中表现不佳，特别是涉及网格、符号或视觉模式等与自然语言训练数据不同表示形式的任务。

Method: 使用Concept单词猜谜游戏作为基准，该游戏使用更接近LLM预训练数据的自然语言表示，评估LLM在不同语言中的表现。

Result: 人类成功率超过90%，而最先进LLM成功率不超过40%，在荷兰语、法语和西班牙语等低资源语言中表现进一步下降。

Conclusion: LLM在解释其他玩家的战略意图和根据序列信息更新修正初始假设方面存在困难，表明在抽象推理能力上仍有显著差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many
benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In
particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often
because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns
that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper,
we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for
probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM
pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily
solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging
for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically,
we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic
intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information
updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and
find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch,
French, and Spanish) compared to English.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language
Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun
exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for
retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance
improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness
while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead
to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents,
covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness,
think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations
reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant
room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce
VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in
Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness
rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that
models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning
faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖固定的干预强度，导致要么控制不足，要么干预过度而降低文本的合理性和连贯性。

Method: IDS方法根据输入数据在表示空间中的分布情况动态调整干预强度，使干预强度与输入在分布中的位置相适应。

Result: 实验表明IDS在分类任务上实现了高准确率，同时生成连贯的文本而不会崩溃，特别适合实际应用。

Conclusion: IDS通过自适应干预强度的方法，在保持文本质量的同时有效控制LLM行为，为实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by
modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing
activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to
either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text
plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a
novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution
in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how
far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention
and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that
IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent
text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly
as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial
intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent
interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In
practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)
Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering
self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance
remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and
solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system
operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and
adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex
scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective
collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The
open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,
hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored
for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent
architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative
problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including
data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario
adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently,
WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key

emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic
content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech,
undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control.
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt
alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains
underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly
addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing
an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected
mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference
models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on
emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional
expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and
intelligibility.

### [144] [LLM one-shot style transfer for Authorship Attribution and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13302)
*Pablo Miralles-González,Javier Huertas-Tato,Alejandro Martín,David Camacho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM预训练和上下文学习能力的无监督方法，使用LLM的对数概率来测量文本间的风格可转移性，在控制主题相关性时优于对比训练基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算风格分析方法依赖带有伪相关性的数据，经常混淆风格与主题。现代LLM的CLM预训练在通用作者身份问题中很少被利用。

Method: 利用LLM的广泛预训练和上下文学习能力，通过LLM的对数概率来测量从一个文本到另一个文本的风格可转移性。

Result: 显著优于同等规模的LLM提示方法，在控制主题相关性时比对比训练基线获得更高准确率。性能随基础模型大小和测试时计算量增加而提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在作者身份验证等任务中实现了计算成本与准确性之间的灵活权衡，展示了LLM预训练在计算风格分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns
in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking
and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised
and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often
confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text
detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for
general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on
this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs,
employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from
one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting
approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively
trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover,
performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in
the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that
increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between
computational cost and accuracy.

*Simon Lupart,Mohammad Aliannejadi,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatR1是一个基于强化学习的对话问答推理框架，通过交错搜索和推理实现自适应行为，在多个数据集上优于竞争模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话问答中用户意图会随对话轮次演变，话语通常不完整，需要上下文解释、查询重构以及检索与生成的动态协调，而静态的'重写、检索、生成'流水线无法满足这些需求。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的推理框架，通过意图感知奖励解决稀疏和延迟奖励问题，在对话轮次中交错进行搜索和推理。

Result: 在3B和7B模型骨干上均表现出色，在五个CQA数据集上使用不同指标（F1、BERTScore、LLM-as-judge）均优于竞争模型，并能很好地泛化到不同领域。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的推理比静态CQA流水线实现了更灵活和上下文敏感的行为，消融研究证实了意图感知奖励的有效性。

Abstract: We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL)
for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role
in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are
often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation,
and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static
`rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and
reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned
through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we
propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning
retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1
demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones,
outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different
metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA
datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues,
and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various
aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward.
Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of
the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating
that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior
than static CQA pipelines.

*Ye Yuan,Mohammad Amin Shabani,Siqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EBCAR，一种轻量级的重排序框架，通过嵌入和混合注意力机制增强跨段落理解，解决RAG系统中跨段落推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统将长文档分割成短段落进行检索，但忽略了跨段落推理的需求，如指代消解、实体消歧和证据聚合等问题。

Method: 使用嵌入和混合注意力机制，直接对检索段落的嵌入进行操作，通过段落结构信息捕获文档间高层交互和文档内低层关系。

Result: 在ConTEB基准测试中优于现有SOTA重排序方法，在需要跨段落推理的信息检索任务中表现出色，兼具准确性和效率优势。

Conclusion: EBCAR框架有效解决了RAG系统中跨段落推理的挑战，在保持轻量级的同时提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant
evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of
splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained
and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when
a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving
coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across
multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite
utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high
inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we
propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking
framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced
cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages
and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions
across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate
EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its
effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and
its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

*Yuan Feng,Haoyu Guo,JunLin Lv,S. Kevin Zhou,Xike Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DefensiveKV和Layer-DefensiveKV方法，通过防御性聚合策略控制最坏情况风险，显著减少KV缓存的内存和运行时开销，同时最小化生成质量损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于稳定性假设（固定子集在整个生成过程中始终重要），但该假设本质脆弱，使均值聚合在极端情况下高度脆弱。

Method: 采用两步线性时间防御性聚合策略控制最坏情况风险，提出DefensiveKV及其扩展Layer-DefensiveKV（包含分层预算分配）。

Result: 在7个任务领域（18个数据集）上，在20%缓存大小下，分别将生成质量损失减少2.3倍和4.3倍，优于最强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法设定了新的性能基准，并为通过最坏情况风险管理优化缓存驱逐开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet
their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime
overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods
employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,
based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains
consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely
focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean
aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,
we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean
aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a
simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time
approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases
with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a
novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,
which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18
datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x
respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These
results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for
optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk
management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

TL;DR: 利用NLP技术分析希腊谚语情感分布，通过LLM进行情感分类并绘制希腊各地区情感分布图，发现希腊大部分地区负面情感谚语更普遍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索全球谚语文化景观，特别是希腊谚语的情感特征，利用NLP技术分析传统智慧的情感分布。

Method: 使用LLM进行谚语情感分类，扩展希腊谚语数据集包含方言，结合地理位置、方言和主题进行组合分析。

Result: LLM能准确识别谚语情感，希腊大部分地区负面情感谚语更普遍。

Conclusion: LLM在非常规情感极性任务中表现良好，希腊谚语情感分布呈现地域特征，负面情感占主导。

Abstract: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend
cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of
proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional
wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the
phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment.
Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include
local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a
way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs,
(2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment,
(3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and
topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate
enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a
non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece
negative sentiment is more prevalent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Protect是一个原生多模态护栏模型，专为企业级部署设计，可在文本、图像和音频输入上无缝运行，在毒性、性别歧视、数据隐私和提示注入四个安全维度上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在企业关键领域的部署增加，现有护栏系统在实时监督、多模态数据处理和可解释性方面存在不足，无法满足受监管环境的需求。

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)在广泛的多模态数据集上训练特定类别的适配器，采用教师辅助标注管道生成高质量、上下文感知的跨模态标签。

Result: 实验结果显示在所有安全维度上都达到了最先进性能，超越了WildGuard、LlamaGuard-4和GPT-4.1等现有模型。

Conclusion: Protect为可信、可审计且生产就绪的安全系统奠定了坚实基础，能够跨文本、图像和音频模态运行。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise
and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust
guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing
solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling,
and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated
environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text
alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We
introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate
seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade
deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering
four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection.
Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation
traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety
dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard,
LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for
trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of
operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

TL;DR: 分析了联邦学习环境下ASR模型对属性推断攻击的脆弱性，在被动威胁模型下测试了三种ASR模型，发现仅通过权重差异就能推断敏感属性，特别是预训练数据中代表性不足的属性更易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究联邦学习环境中ASR模型的安全漏洞，特别是针对属性推断攻击的脆弱性，以揭示隐私保护训练方法中存在的潜在风险。

Method: 采用非参数白盒攻击方法，在被动威胁模型下测试Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Whisper三种ASR模型，仅使用权重差异而不访问原始语音数据。

Result: 攻击能够成功推断性别、年龄、口音、情绪和构音障碍等敏感属性，其中口音信息在所有模型中最易被推断，预训练数据中代表性不足的属性更易受攻击。

Conclusion: 联邦ASR模型存在先前未记录的脆弱性，研究结果为改进模型安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of
machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR
models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a
non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three
ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight
differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate
attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,
age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes
that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more
vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents
can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously
undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards
improved security.

*Xiang Lei,Qin Li,Min Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D-SMART是一个模型无关的框架，通过动态结构化记忆和推理树来保持多轮对话的事实和逻辑一致性，显著提升对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多轮对话中出现事实不一致和逻辑衰减的问题，现有方法如RAG和记忆机制仍依赖静态知识源，无法适应动态对话上下文。

Method: 包含两个组件：(1) 动态结构化记忆(DSM) - 增量构建和维护对话的知识图谱；(2) 推理树(RT) - 在图上执行显式的多步推理搜索。

Result: 在MT-Bench-101基准测试中，D-SMART显著优于现有方法，对话一致性得分提升超过48%，开源模型质量得分提升达10.1%。

Conclusion: D-SMART通过动态结构化表示和显式推理有效解决了多轮对话的一致性问题，为LLMs在复杂对话场景中的应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and
logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from
their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason
adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve
information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources
and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to
preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn
dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we
propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn
dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,
structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via
two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which
incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant
knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which
executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the
graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical
flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue
consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that
D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the
dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source
models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯说服框架的自然语言说服方法，通过承诺-沟通机制增强大语言模型的战略说服能力，在单轮对话中取得了比非贝叶斯方法更高的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在说服能力方面存在挑战，现有研究往往忽视信息不对称的战略使用或依赖强假设。本文旨在探索贝叶斯说服在自然语言对话中的应用，提升LLMs的战略说服能力。

Method: 提出承诺-沟通机制，说服者明确描述其可能类型（如诚实或不诚实），引导被说服者进行贝叶斯信念更新。评估了半正式自然语言和全自然语言两种变体，并与非贝叶斯基线进行比较。

Result: 实验发现：(1) 基于BP策略的LLMs始终获得比NBP基线更高的说服成功率；(2) SFNL具有更好的可信度和逻辑一致性，FNL在自然对话中表现出更强的情绪共鸣和鲁棒性；(3) 通过监督微调，小模型可以达到与大模型相当的BP性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服框架能有效提升LLMs的战略说服能力，不同变体各有优势，且模型规模不是决定性能的唯一因素，通过适当训练小模型也能达到良好效果。

Abstract: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge
for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often
overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely
on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the
application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn
dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.
Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the
persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their
potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in
performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our
approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language
(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)
baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a
diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and
fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially
designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental
results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP
strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP
baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while
FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic
conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP
performance comparable to that of larger models.

Motivation: 探索生成代理模型Concordia是否能有效模拟心智理论，评估GPT-4是否能从社交情境进行真正推理而非依赖语言记忆。

Method: 使用生成代理模型Concordia在模拟真实世界环境中评估GPT-4的心智理论能力，测试其是否基于信念归因选择行动。

Result: GPT-4经常无法基于信念归因选择行动，在复杂社交互动中难以生成连贯因果效应，表明先前观察到的心智理论能力可能源于浅层统计关联。

Conclusion: 当前关于大语言模型中心智理论能力涌现的说法受到挑战，需要更严格的基于行动的评价框架。

Abstract: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the
exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared
interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of
Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess
whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4
can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than
relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation:
GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution,
suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may
stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning.
Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from
agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions.
These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities
in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation
frameworks.

Motivation: 语言意义如何演变及其决定因素尚未完全理解，共词化现象为研究意义变化动态提供了重要窗口。

Method: 使用系统发育比较模型分析南岛语系、印欧语系和乌拉尔语系的词典数据，评估关联性、借用性和使用频率三个预测因素的影响。

Result: 关联性强的概念对在语系中更广泛共词化且变化更慢；高频和易借用的概念对变化更快且较少共词化；不同语系间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 概念关联性促进共词化稳定性，而频率和借用性加速变化；区域和文化因素在意义演变中起重要作用。

Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with
ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the
factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly
understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct
concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the
dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic
comparative models to dictionary data from three language families,
Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the
evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess
the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage
frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are
colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates
of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to
borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also
find considerable differences between the language families under study,
suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DPO方法在机器翻译中存在两个主要限制：(1)质量估计模型提供的奖励信号存在缺陷，忽略了关键错误如翻译幻觉；(2)数据利用效率低下，仅选择单一胜负对丢弃了有价值的学习信号。

Method: 提出M^2PO框架，包含：1）多视角奖励引擎，结合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分；2）多对构造策略，从所有翻译候选中系统创建全面的偏好对集合。

Result: 在WMT21-22基准测试中，M^2PO显著优于现有偏好优化方法，并与领先的专有LLM表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: M^2PO通过多视角奖励和多对构造的协同方法，能够从更丰富的质量权衡谱中学习，产生更鲁棒和忠实的翻译。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT),
but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed
reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical
errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization
that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss
pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair,
Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a
multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining
two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an
innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations
with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a
multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive
set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This
synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality
trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging
WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference
optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against
leading proprietary LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LiteraryQA，这是NarrativeQA的一个高质量子集，专注于文学作品，通过人工和LLM验证的流程来识别和修正低质量QA样本，并移除源文档中的无关文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叙事文本上的问答任务对现有系统提出了独特挑战，需要深入理解长而复杂的文档。然而，该领域最广泛使用的基准测试NarrativeQA因文档噪声和有缺陷的QA对而可靠性受限。

Method: 使用人工和LLM验证的流程来识别和修正低质量QA样本，同时从源文档中移除无关文本。然后对自动指标进行元评估，以明确系统在LiteraryQA上应如何评估。

Result: 分析显示所有基于n-gram的指标与人类判断的系统级相关性较低，而LLM-as-a-Judge评估（即使是小型开源模型）能与人类确定的排名高度一致。

Conclusion: LiteraryQA为叙事文本问答提供了一个更可靠的基准，LLM评估方法比传统n-gram指标更符合人类判断，为长上下文LLM的评估提供了更好的基准。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current
systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,
the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,
is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce
LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.
Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality
QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry
out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be
evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics
have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the
ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs
on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.

Motivation: 理解人类意图是LLMs的复杂高级任务，但现实世界的公共讨论具有交织冲突观点、不同关注点和目标等特点。目前缺乏大规模基准来评估LLMs在真实世界意图理解上的能力。

Method: 构建了\bench基准，这是专门为意图理解设计的动态实时评估基准，特别关注消费者领域，采用自动化筛选流程确保数据质量。

Result: \bench成为目前最大、最多样化的意图理解基准，支持实时更新并能有效防止数据污染问题。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了意图理解评估领域的空白，为LLMs在复杂真实世界场景中的意图理解能力提供了可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language
models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation,
dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely
linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven
and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional
tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about
usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM
must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source
signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar
to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,
uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no
large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human
intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world
public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark
specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer
domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,
supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an
automated curation pipeline.

Method: 构建MedVersa基准测试集，提出MedREK框架，包含共享查询-键模块和基于注意力的提示编码器。

Result: 在多个医疗基准测试中，MedREK在不同核心指标上均取得优越性能，首次验证了医疗LLMs批量编辑的可行性。

Conclusion: MedREK为医疗LLMs提供了有效的知识更新解决方案，特别在批量编辑方面填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution
of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate
outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes
clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full
retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is
thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more
viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)
representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes
inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are
restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely
unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To
address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced
benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both
single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose
MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key
module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for
informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks
demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core
metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical
LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at

Motivation: LLM的推理模式不透明，传统强化学习对整个生成过程采用统一信用分配，无法区分关键步骤和常规步骤。

Method: 区分局部和全局注意力头，提出窗口平均注意力距离和未来注意力影响两个指标，识别预规划-锚定机制，并设计三种针对关键节点的强化学习策略。

Result: 提出的强化学习策略在各种推理任务上表现出一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过将优化与模型内在推理节奏对齐，将不透明的优化转变为可操作的结构感知过程，为LLM推理的透明有效优化提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在不同语言间表现不均衡，高资源语言和低资源语言之间存在显著性能差距。需要一种成本效益高的方法来增强LLM在低资源语言上的能力。

Method: 使用语言激活概率熵识别语言特定神经元，仅微调与这些神经元相关的权重（专用子网络）在目标语言数据上。

Result: 在12种中低资源语言上的实验表明，该方法在性能上持续优于全微调、仅FFN微调、LoRA适配和随机子集微调基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为将最先进模型适配到低资源语言提供了一条成本效益高的路径，同时发布了100多种语言的语言特定神经元识别结果和适配流程。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with
substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a
framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented
languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted
fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies
language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and
fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated
subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and
Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA
adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating
only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe
enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment,
and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release
language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our
adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting
state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成基准面临LLM训练数据污染和领域不平衡问题，且非英语数据集有限。

Method: 从维基百科实时收集表格数据，生成多语言（英语、德语、俄语、法语）的表格到文本基准数据集。

Result: 自动指标显示LLM从新表格生成的见解明显较差，但LLM和人工评估未体现此差异；领域效应在所有评估中均可见。

Conclusion: FreshTab能有效对抗数据污染，领域平衡的基准更具挑战性，多语言扩展提升了评估的全面性。

Abstract: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging
task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation
of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model
(LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an
on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM
data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While
non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in
different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in
addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent
tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but
this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are
visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more
challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法虽然减少了内存访问，但KV缓存大小未缩减，限制了GPU批处理规模和解码吞吐量，尤其是在大规模批处理推理中。

Method: 通过将token选择分解为查询感知和查询无关组件，引入显式局部性约束，减少KV传输，同时保持与训练时相同的注意力计算。

Result: 预训练的1B参数模型在保持接近无损性能的同时，相比基线方法(InfLLM-V2)实现了最高2.3倍的解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: NOSA框架有效解决了KV缓存卸载问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了解码效率，为大规模批处理推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoTime是一个记忆增强的时间知识图谱框架，通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习来增强LLM的时间推理能力，在多个时间QA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在时间理解方面存在困难，特别是在涉及多实体、复合运算符和演化事件序列的问题中。现有基于时间知识图谱的方法面临四个主要挑战：多跳推理中的时间忠实性、多实体时间同步、适应不同时间运算符的检索、以及重用先前推理经验。

Method: MemoTime将复杂时间问题分解为时间树层次结构，实现运算符感知推理，强制执行单调时间戳并在统一时间边界下共同约束多个实体。动态证据检索层自适应选择运算符特定的检索策略，自演化经验记忆存储已验证的推理轨迹、工具包决策和子问题嵌入以供跨类型重用。

Result: 在多个时间QA基准测试中，MemoTime实现了整体最先进的结果，比强基线提高了24.0%。此外，MemoTime使较小模型（如Qwen3-4B）能够达到与GPT-4-Turbo相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: MemoTime通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习有效解决了时间推理中的关键挑战，显著提升了LLM的时间理解能力，并使小模型也能获得强大的时间推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities,
but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve
multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a
structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,
existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major
challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving
multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal
operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal
knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured
grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime
decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,
enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and
co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic
evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval
strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning
traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime
achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by
up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to
achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

Motivation: 德国肿瘤诊断的ICD-10-GM和ICD-O-3准确编码对结构化癌症文档至关重要，但开源小模型在德语环境中编码准确性不足，需要提升其自动化编码能力。

Method: 基于ICD-10-GM、ICD-O-3和OPS目录创建了50多万个问答对作为训练数据，对Qwen、Llama和Mistral家族的8个开源模型（7-70B参数）进行指令微调。

Result: ICD-10-GM准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%，部分准确率从31-74%提升至73-83%；ICD-O-3地形编码准确率从较低水平提升至22-40%，畸形代码输出降至0%，肿瘤诊断识别率达到99%。

Conclusion: 利用公开目录构建指令数据集可以有效提升LLM在医疗文档任务中的性能，模型大小与准确性正相关但微调后差距缩小，推理模式性能较低且速度慢100倍。

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from

Conclusion: SALAD提供了一种数据高效的方法来缩小文本-语音理解差距，通过跨模态蒸馏和针对性数据选择，在减少数据依赖的同时保持竞争力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities
to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform
their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language
understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:
the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs
relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.
Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech
synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic
data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not
reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient
alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we
analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities
during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.
Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with
Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines
cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment
while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves
competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain
benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training
on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

Method: 系统性地研究了基于采样的解码对可检测性的影响，重点关注模型在(子)词级别分布的细微变化如何影响检测性能。

Conclusion: 当前检测方法存在关键盲点，需要更全面的评估协议。作者发布了包含37种解码配置的大规模数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and
often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text
detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report
near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these
claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of
how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we
systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with
a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution
affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding
parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely
impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\%
in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection
methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To
facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37

Conclusion: NExT-OMNI作为下一代多模态基础模型，通过离散流范式实现了统一建模，在理解和生成能力间取得平衡，具有架构优势，并开源了训练细节、数据协议、代码和模型检查点。

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,
NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and
understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in
multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its
architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To
advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and
open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

TL;DR: 提出了GAPS框架，通过自动化管道构建多维评估基准，用于全面评估AI临床系统的认知深度、答案完整性、鲁棒性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI临床系统基准主要基于选择题考试或人工评分标准，无法捕捉真实临床实践所需的深度、鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 开发了全自动、指南锚定的管道，构建证据邻域，创建双重图树表示，自动生成跨G级别的问题，使用DeepResearch代理合成评分标准，并由LLM评委进行评分。

Result: 验证显示自动生成的问题质量高且与临床医生判断一致。评估发现最先进模型存在关键失败模式：推理深度增加时性能急剧下降，答案完整性不足，对对抗性扰动和某些安全问题高度脆弱。

Conclusion: 这种自动化、临床基础的方法为严格评估AI临床系统提供了可重复和可扩展的方法，指导其向更安全、可靠的临床实践发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice
exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety
required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the
GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding
(cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),
\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we
developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a
GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity
limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,
creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates
questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that
mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring
is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation
confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician
judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key
failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth
(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain
safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a
reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems
and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估聊天助手网络搜索行为的新方法，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性。通过对100个涉及五个易产生错误信息主题的声明进行评估，比较了GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着聊天助手集成网络搜索功能，虽然能提供更可靠的答案，但也存在放大低可信度来源错误信息的风险。需要系统评估这些助手在事实核查方面的行为。

Method: 使用100个涉及五个错误信息易发主题的声明，评估GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat四个聊天助手，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性。

Result: 不同助手表现存在差异，Perplexity获得最高的来源可信度，而GPT-4o在敏感话题上引用了更多非可信来源。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统比较了常用聊天助手的事实核查行为，为在高风险信息环境中评估AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling
them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable
answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from
low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for
evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and
the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims
across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity,
and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with
Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits
elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work
provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for
fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in
high-stakes information environments.

*Zhiqi Huang,Vivek Datla,Chenyang Zhu,Alfy Samuel,Daben Liu,Anoop Kumar,Ritesh Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于前馈网络激活的置信度估计方法，用于检索增强生成系统，在金融行业应用中优于基线方法并满足严格的延迟要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融和医疗等高风险领域，置信度估计至关重要，因为错误答案的成本远高于不回答问题。现有方法在投影和softmax归一化过程中存在信息损失。

Method: 利用原始前馈网络激活作为自回归信号，将置信度预测建模为序列分类任务，并使用Huber损失进行正则化以提高对噪声监督的鲁棒性。

Result: 在真实金融行业客户支持场景中，该方法优于强基线，在严格延迟约束下保持高准确率。使用Llama 3.1 8B模型的第16层激活可在保持准确性的同时减少响应延迟。

Conclusion: 基于激活的置信度建模为可信赖的RAG部署提供了一条可扩展、架构感知的路径。

Abstract: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large
language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in
high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an
incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach
extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward
network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information
loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax
normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification
task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness
against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry
customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms
strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.
Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the
16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results
demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,
architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大规模训练的语言模型中符号接地现象的具体位置和驱动机制，填补现有研究中对这一现象内部机制理解不足的空白。

Method: 引入受控评估框架，通过机制性和因果分析系统追踪符号接地在内部计算中的出现过程。

Result: 发现接地集中在中间层计算，通过注意力头聚合环境基础实现；该现象在多模态对话和不同架构中可复现，但在单向LSTM中不出现。

Conclusion: 提供了行为和机制证据表明符号接地可在语言模型中涌现，对预测和控制生成可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

*Giovanni Monea,Yair Feldman,Shankar Padmanabhan,Kianté Brantley,Yoav Artzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过学习压缩生成KV缓存的方法来解决大语言模型长上下文推理中的内存和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理中的可扩展性受到Transformer键值缓存线性增长的严重限制，导致显著的内存和计算成本。随着模型生成推理标记，过去生成标记的信息价值会减少，这为压缩创造了机会。

Method: 定期使用学习到的专用标记压缩生成KV缓存，并驱逐压缩条目。通过改进的联合蒸馏和强化学习框架训练模型执行这种压缩，利用RL输出进行蒸馏以最小化训练开销。

Result: 经验证明，该方法在内存-准确率帕累托边界上优于无缓存压缩的模型和无训练压缩技术。

Conclusion: 通过学习压缩KV缓存的方法，可以有效解决长上下文推理中的内存和计算瓶颈问题，实现更好的内存效率与准确率的平衡。

Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is
severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache,
which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a
model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated
tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we
propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned,
special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to
perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the
conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation.
Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier
compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free
compression techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRIEF-Pro是一个轻量级的通用压缩器，通过抽象压缩将检索文档中的相关证据提炼为简洁摘要，用于增强检索-增强生成(RAG)系统，特别是在处理复杂多跳问题时显著提高性能并降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG处理复杂任务时上下文不断扩展，虽然提供了更丰富的信息，但也带来了更高的延迟和模型认知负担。需要解决这一瓶颈，特别是针对复杂的多跳问题。

Method: 使用相对较短的上下文（少于1000词）作为种子数据，训练BRIEF-Pro对超过10000词的扩展上下文进行抽象压缩，并允许用户灵活控制摘要长度。

Result: 在四个开放域多跳问答数据集上的实验表明，BRIEF-Pro生成更简洁相关的摘要，显著提升了小型、大型和专有语言模型的性能。使用70B阅读器模型时，32倍压缩比LongLLMLingua的9倍压缩平均提升QA性能4.67%，而计算开销仅为其23%。

Conclusion: BRIEF-Pro通过高效的上下文压缩有效缓解了RAG系统的延迟和认知负担问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly
expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency
and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,
especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a
universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given
query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration
into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts
(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression
of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.
Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by
allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four
open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates
more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,
and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by
BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,
while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LT-Gate脉冲神经元模型，通过双时间尺度动态和自适应门控机制解决SNN在持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境，在时序分类任务中达到51%准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在神经形态硬件上具有能效优势，但在需要快速适应和长期记忆的持续学习任务中表现不佳，特别是面临稳定性-可塑性困境。

Method: LT-Gate模型让每个脉冲神经元并行跟踪快慢两个时间尺度的信息，通过学习的门控机制局部调整其影响，并引入方差跟踪正则化来稳定放电活动。

Result: 在时序分类基准测试中达到约51%的最终准确率，优于Hebbian持续学习基线的46%和先前的SNN方法，且无需外部重放或昂贵的正交化操作。

Conclusion: 多时间尺度门控可显著增强SNN的持续学习能力，缩小脉冲网络与传统深度网络在终身学习任务上的差距，并与Intel Loihi芯片等神经形态硬件完全兼容。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM4TS模型中的伪对齐问题，发现其源于预训练LLM的锥效应和时间序列数据低维流形的相互作用，并提出TimeSUP技术通过增加时间序列流形维度来缓解此问题，显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐问题是导致许多时间序列大语言模型表现不如线性模型或随机初始化骨干网络的关键挑战，但社区对此问题的成因讨论有限。

Method: 提出TimeSUP技术，通过增加时间序列流形维度以匹配语言嵌入的内在维度，使模型能清晰区分时间信号同时捕捉跨模态共享结构。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测性能上持续优于最先进的LLM4TS方法和其他轻量级基线，并能无缝集成到四种现有LLM4TS流程中带来显著改进。

Conclusion: TimeSUP通过解决伪对齐问题，使时间和语言标记的表示保持区分性但具有高余弦相似度，在统一嵌入空间中保留各模态独特特征的同时学习其共性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的类增量学习问题，特别是处理任务序列中的统计异质性、数据不确定性，同时保持通信效率和隐私保护。

Method: 客户端使用Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder生成高斯分布的任务嵌入，服务器端使用2-Wasserstein距离衡量任务间差距并强制任务分离，避免直接传输潜在嵌入保护隐私。

Result: 在多个流行数据集上的实验表明，FedGTEA实现了优越的分类性能，显著减轻了遗忘问题，持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和对齐方法，为联邦类增量学习提供了一个可扩展、通信高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

Motivation: 利用自然执行能量下降的物理系统来加速机器学习，特别是通过OIMs的GHz频率动态来模拟能量基模型(EBMs)的优化和梯度下降，同时内在噪声对应朗之万动力学。

Method: 在振荡器伊辛机上实现平衡传播(EP)，将优化和采样过程统一到单一总能量景观的下降中，实现无需全局反向传播的局部学习规则。

Result: 在MNIST上达到约97.2±0.1%的准确率，在Fashion-MNIST上达到约88.0±0.1%的准确率，并在参数量化和相位噪声等实际硬件约束下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OIMs成为快速、节能的神经形态学习基底，表明EBMs可以在直接执行其优化的物理硬件上找到实际实现途径。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

TL;DR: 该论文开发了首个在状态对抗MDP中剪枝认证鲁棒性的理论框架，证明剪枝只能增强策略的鲁棒性，并通过实验发现在中等稀疏度下存在性能-鲁棒性的最佳平衡点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习策略需要对抗性扰动下保持可靠性，而现代深度RL代理过度参数化导致成本和脆弱性问题。虽然剪枝在监督学习中已被证明能提升鲁棒性，但其在对抗性RL中的作用尚不明确。

Method: 为高斯和分类策略开发理论框架，证明元素级剪枝能收紧认证鲁棒性边界；提出三阶段遗憾分解方法，分离干净任务性能、剪枝引起的性能损失和鲁棒性增益；在连续控制基准上评估幅度剪枝和微剪枝策略。

Result: 实验表明剪枝在中等稀疏度水平下能一致发现可复现的"最佳点"，鲁棒性显著提升而不损害甚至有时增强干净性能。

Conclusion: 剪枝不仅是压缩工具，更是实现鲁棒强化学习的结构性干预手段。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

Conclusion: 该工作为评估医疗基础模型中的隐私记忆风险提供了系统框架，有助于在临床应用中平衡模型效用与患者隐私保护。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health
records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity
to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent

approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1%
explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable
baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with
bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges
the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a

### [184] [Balancing Performance and Reject Inclusion: A Novel Confident Inlier Extrapolation Framework for Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12967)
*Athyrson Machado Ribeiro,Marcos Medeiros Raimundo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CI-EX的自信内点外推框架，用于解决信用评分中的拒绝推断问题，通过迭代识别被拒客户样本分布并基于监督分类模型概率为最接近接受人群分布的个体分配标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝推断方法通常假设被拒客户行为可以从接受客户外推，但两个群体可能存在分布差异，需要减少这种盲目外推。

Method: CI-EX框架迭代使用异常检测模型识别被拒客户样本分布，基于监督分类模型的概率为最接近接受人群分布的个体分配标签。

Result: 在两个大型真实世界信用数据集上的实验表明，CI-EX在拒绝推断特定指标上始终优于现有方法，同时在AUC指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 拒绝推断方法通常涉及AUC与RI特定指标之间的权衡，但提出的CI-EX框架在RI特定指标上表现优异，同时保持AUC竞争力。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用去噪分数匹配损失作为局部内在维度(LID)的估计器，该方法比现有方法更高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化高维复杂数据局部内在维度的方法需要多次前向传播或梯度计算，在计算和内存受限场景中应用受限。

Method: 通过理论证明LID是去噪分数匹配损失的下界，从而将其用作LID估计器，并与隐式分数匹配损失和FLIPD估计器建立联系。

Result: 在流形基准测试和Stable Diffusion 3.5上的实验表明，该方法在精度和内存占用方面优于现有方法，且随着问题规模和量化级别的增加表现更优。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种高效、可扩展的LID估计器，特别适用于计算和内存受限的场景。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

TL;DR: 提出了FADE指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来评估分布相似性，解决了现有遗忘评估方法的系统性盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型的遗忘指标基于参考响应或分类器输出评估，而非核心目标——评估未学习模型是否与从未见过不需要数据的模型行为无法区分。这种参考特定方法存在系统性盲点。

Method: 提出功能性对齐分布等价性(FADE)指标，通过比较未学习模型和参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配来测量分布相似性，捕捉整个输出分布的功能性对齐。

Result: 在TOFU和UnlearnCanvas基准上的实验显示，传统指标接近最优的方法未能实现分布等价性，许多方法在遗忘后比遗忘前距离黄金标准更远。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践存在根本性差距，FADE为开发和评估真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的基础。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

TL;DR: CSI-4CAST是一个混合深度学习架构，通过整合CNN残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer，有效捕获CSI预测中的局部和长程依赖关系，在计算效率和预测精度方面显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在应对实际非高斯噪声、跨信道条件泛化能力和计算效率方面存在局限性，需要开发更鲁棒和高效的CSI预测方法。

Method: 提出CSI-4CAST混合架构，集成4个关键组件：卷积神经网络残差、自适应校正层、ShuffleNet块和Transformer，以高效捕获CSI预测中的局部和长程依赖关系。

Result: 在TDD场景中88.9%和FDD场景中43.8%的情况下优于基线模型，计算量相比最强基线LLM4CP减少5倍和3倍，同时建立了包含30万样本的CSI-RRG基准数据集。

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST在CSI预测方面实现了优越的精度和计算效率，同时发布的基准数据集和评估协议为鲁棒高效CSI预测研究提供了标准化平台。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

Conclusion: NeuroRVQ为基于码本的通用脑电模型建立了强大的先验基础，推动了神经解码、生成建模和多模态生物信号集成的发展。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

Motivation: 理解LLMs推理能力的具体来源和机制，特别是优化推理能力，这对规划、控制、资源分配等关键应用至关重要。

Method: 引入ExtremBench基准数据集，包含93个标准化极值问题，对多个开源模型家族进行广泛评估。

Result: 发现LLMs的极值求解推理能力与当前数学基准测试结果不一致，有些模型在一般数学推理上表现强但在极值求解上表现差，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 现有基准测试实践存在关键差距，可能无法全面捕捉数学推理能力的完整谱系。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 刚性系统的时间积分在燃烧、高超声速等反应输运系统中是主要计算成本来源，需要开发能够缓解刚性挑战的策略。

Conclusion: AMORE是一个通用框架，除了DeepONet外也适用于FNO，将成为未来CFD研究中加速湍流燃烧模拟的基础。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动框架在细胞命运决策的非凸Waddington景观中容易陷入局部最优，导致轨迹陷入虚假谱系或不合理的分化结果，需要设计良好的初始化方法来逃离局部最优并收敛到正确的谱系。

Method: 采用多阶段强化学习算法：首先使用Fisher向量积和共轭梯度求解器计算显式自然梯度更新，通过KL信任域约束提供安全、曲率感知的策略第一步；然后应用带有裁剪替代的近端策略优化（PPO），利用小批量效率来细化策略。

Result: 这种初始化方法在单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）和单细胞ATAC测序（scATAC-seq）扰动分析中显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多阶段强化学习方法通过精心设计的初始化策略，有效解决了单细胞扰动建模中的局部最优问题，为细胞命运决策预测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Result: 该集成框架能够处理现实世界中的分布外测量数据，为真实数据的自动化焊接检测提供端到端解决方案。

Conclusion: 该工作成功解决了焊接检测中的数据稀缺和信号污染问题，实现了工业环境下可靠的自动化检测。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

Conclusion: 通过信息瓶颈视角重新思考Koopman学习，提出的信息论方法能够获得稳定且可解释的Koopman表示，在表达性和简洁性之间实现更好平衡。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions

### [197] [Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052)
*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过时变优化视角研究流数据学习问题，提出基于权重的结构化公式，分析均匀权重和折扣权重两种策略下的跟踪误差界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化理论处理固定目标函数，但动态环境中的决策需要时变优化方法。本文旨在从流数据学习的角度研究时变优化问题。

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，分别研究均匀权重（平等对待所有样本）和折扣权重（几何衰减旧数据影响）两种策略，在梯度下降更新下分析跟踪误差。

Result: 均匀权重下跟踪误差以O(1/t)速率渐近消失，折扣权重下存在非零误差下限，由折扣因子和每时间步梯度更新次数控制。

Conclusion: 理论分析揭示了不同权重策略对跟踪误差的影响，数值模拟验证了理论结果，为流数据学习提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了KL正则化在博弈论设置中的理论优势，提出了OMG和SOMG算法，在矩阵博弈和马尔可夫博弈中实现了对数级后悔，且后悔随KL正则化强度β的增大而减小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然KL正则化在强化学习中广泛使用，特别是在对齐任务中取得了显著经验成功，但其在博弈论设置中的理论优势仍不清楚。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 提出了OMG算法（用于矩阵博弈）和SOMG算法（用于马尔可夫博弈），两者都基于最佳响应采样和乐观奖励机制。SOMG还引入了超乐观奖励的新概念。

Result: 两种算法都实现了对数级后悔，后悔随KL正则化强度β的增大而减小，同时保持了与β无关的标准√T后悔界。

Conclusion: KL正则化在博弈论设置中确实能带来理论优势，特别是在样本效率方面，提出的算法为理解KL正则化的理论效益提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

Motivation: 现有聚类有效性指数通常是相对的，依赖于数据结构和算法比较，难以直接识别"真实"簇。需要开发绝对指标来直接评估聚类的紧凑性和分离性。

Method: 定义簇的紧凑度函数和簇对之间的邻近点集，利用这些函数计算每个簇的紧凑度和整体分布紧凑性，使用邻近点集定义簇间边界和整体分布边界。

Conclusion: 提出的紧凑性和分离性指数能够有效识别真实簇的数量，为聚类分析提供了新的绝对评估工具。

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Transformer的无监督深度学习框架，用于大规模MU-MISO系统的下行波束成形，通过离线训练实现实时推理，性能接近WMMSE但推理速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模多用户MISO系统中波束成形的计算复杂性问题，传统迭代方法计算量大，难以满足实时通信需求。

Method: 采用学习优化范式，使用多层Transformer通过残差连接迭代优化信道和波束成形器特征，并引入课程学习、半摊销学习和滑动窗口训练三种策略来增强训练效果。

Result: 在低到中等信噪比下优于现有基线方法，在高信噪比下性能接近WMMSE，同时推理速度显著快于迭代和在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 该无监督深度学习框架为大规模MU-MISO系统提供了一种高效、实时的波束成形解决方案，在性能和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

TL;DR: DeepCausalMMM是一个结合深度学习、因果推断和营销科学的Python包，用于改进传统营销组合建模，能够自动学习时间模式、渠道依赖关系和饱和效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统营销组合建模方法依赖线性回归或贝叶斯分层模型，假设营销渠道间独立，难以捕捉复杂的时间动态和非线性饱和效应。

Method: 使用门控循环单元(GRU)自动学习时间模式(如广告存续效应和滞后)，通过有向无环图(DAG)学习营销渠道间的统计依赖关系和潜在因果结构，并实现基于Hill方程的饱和曲线建模。

Result: 该包实现了数据驱动的设计，超参数和转换从数据中学习或估计，支持多区域建模，包含稳健的统计方法和全面的响应曲线分析，提供14+交互式仪表板用于业务洞察。

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM通过结合深度学习和因果推断，解决了传统营销组合建模的局限性，提供了更准确和自动化的营销效果评估与预算优化方案。

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在保持可逆结构的同时，实现了精确稀疏性和计算效率的平衡，为大规模晶格场理论采样提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Result: 证明MDMs与多项式填充PLTs在理论上是等价的，MDMs能解决所有CoT变换器能解决的问题，且在某些问题类别上MDMs比CoT变换器更高效。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散模型不仅与现有推理框架具有理论等价性，而且其并行生成特性使其在特定问题类别上具有显著的计算效率优势。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Conclusion: CoDa-FL框架有效解决了依赖多任务联邦学习中的客户端选择问题，显著提升了学习效率和性能

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within
mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent
multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various
learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware
framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower
communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under
heterogeneous MEC settings.

Conclusion: 该方法在连续时间模型中有效实现了dropout正则化，具有预测的收敛率、正则化效果以及良好的运行时和内存性能。

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

Conclusion: 提出的准动态框架成功超越了静态和动态表示之间的权衡，为程序表示提供了新范式，在编译器优化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建完备等变GNN提供了理论基础和实用方法，在保持强大实用效能的同时大幅提升效率

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

TL;DR: 比较Ising和QUBO编码在玻尔兹曼机学习中的表现，发现QUBO编码导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数更差，使SGD收敛更慢，而自然梯度下降对两种编码效果相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同变量编码（Ising的{-1,+1} vs QUBO的{0,1}）如何影响玻尔兹曼机的学习动态和信息几何特性。

Method: 在固定模型、采样器和步长的控制协议下，通过可视化经验矩和分析Fisher信息矩阵的特征值分布来比较两种编码。

Result: QUBO编码产生更大的交叉项，导致Fisher信息矩阵有更多小特征值方向，降低了谱熵，使SGD收敛更慢；而自然梯度下降对两种编码收敛相似。

Conclusion: 对于SGD训练，Ising编码提供更各向同性的曲率和更快收敛；对于QUBO编码，中心化/缩放或自然梯度预条件可以缓解曲率问题。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于截断影响函数(TIF)的数据质量评估方法，发现偏好数据质量是模型相关的，并开发了两种简化的评分函数来有效选择高质量偏好数据，从而用更少数据实现更好的对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用外部奖励模型或现成LLM预处理原始训练数据集来识别有价值的偏好对，但很少检查单个数据点是否真正有益。本文旨在开发模型相关的数据质量评估方法。

Method: 提出截断影响函数(TIF)来评估单个数据对验证数据的影响，并开发两种计算更简单的评分函数(SF)，通过组合它们来抵消不同的误差源，形成有效的数据选择规则。

Result: 在多样化对齐基准和多种LLM家族上的实验表明，使用更少数据可以实现更好的对齐性能，证明了方法的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的，需要针对特定模型改进数据选择方法。提出的数据选择规则能够更精确地选择有价值的偏好数据，提高对齐效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FracNet是一个基于频谱分析的图神经网络，通过分解高低频分量进行频率感知的领域自适应，结合对比学习解决领域适应中的模糊边界问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络在领域自适应中表现不佳，主要原因是未能区分处理全局和局部模式，导致图结构细节在多层GNN后受损。领域偏移可以通过频谱分析更好地理解，低频分量编码领域不变的全局模式，高频分量捕获领域特定的局部细节。

Method: 提出FracNet，包含两个协同模块：将原始图分解为高频和低频分量，执行频率感知的领域自适应；结合对比学习框架改善领域自适应中的模糊边界问题。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，相比最先进方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: FracNet通过频谱分解和对比学习的结合，有效解决了图神经网络在领域自适应中的挑战，理论证明和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

specialized models in adopting user perspectives on hate speech and toxicity
detection, while also making use of considerably fewer parameters. Our solution
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of base models out

TL;DR: BlendFL是一个新颖的联邦学习框架，通过混合水平和垂直联邦学习原则，解决多模态数据异构性问题，支持去中心化推理和自适应模型聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中多模态数据异构性挑战，现有联邦学习框架在非理想设置下效果有限，需要处理客户端间模态和样本不对称的情况。

Method: 提出BlendFL框架，同步混合水平和垂直联邦学习方法，支持去中心化推理机制和自适应全局模型聚合策略BlendAvg。

Result: 在三个分类任务上的实验表明，BlendFL在多模态和单模态分类中均表现优异，收敛速度更快，加速了协作学习。

Conclusion: BlendFL在处理多模态数据异构性方面具有潜力，特别适用于医疗和金融等数据隐私至关重要的现实场景。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERA是一个用于引导语言模型通过选择性干预来减少错误的框架，通过优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度，在无法自信修正时选择弃权，从而避免过度或不足干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定、手动调整的引导强度，往往导致引导不足或过度引导的问题，需要更智能的干预机制。

Method: MERA通过优化干预方向和校准干预时机与强度来实现选择性、自适应干预，可应用于现有引导技术之上。

Result: 在多个数据集和语言模型家族上的实验表明，MERA能够安全有效地进行错误修正且不会降低性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MERA被确立为一种通用且高效的机制激活引导方法，能够显著提升现有引导技术的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

TL;DR: 提出了Fed-CCP方法，通过生成模型实现联邦条件下的保形预测，解决联邦学习中数据分布异质性问题，实现条件覆盖而非边际覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准保形预测假设i.i.d.数据，但在联邦学习场景中客户端数据分布差异很大，现有联邦CP方法只能保证边际覆盖，无法反映输入条件不确定性。

Method: 使用生成模型（如归一化流或扩散模型）近似条件数据分布，无需共享原始数据，让每个客户端本地校准反映其独特不确定性的保形分数，通过联邦聚合保持全局一致性。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，Fed-CCP实现了更自适应的预测集。

Conclusion: Fed-CCP通过生成模型有效解决了联邦学习中数据异质性带来的条件覆盖问题，提供了更精确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

Motivation: 生成扩散模型在动力降尺度中缺乏有限样本保证，导致过度自信预测和校准不良的不确定性估计，影响其在业务应用中的可靠性。

Method: 在扩散模型的样本后处理中推导条件分位数估计，并整合到保形化分位数回归过程中，获得具有局部自适应性和有限样本边际有效性的预测区间。

Result: 在意大利ERA5再分析数据上评估，结果显示网格点级别的不确定性估计在覆盖率和稳定概率得分方面相比扩散模型基线显著改善。

Conclusion: 保形化生成模型在高分辨率气象场概率降尺度中具有更可信赖的潜力，能够提供改进的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法面临分布假设冲突、计算效率低、难以处理不同类型异常等基本挑战，需要开发更有效的方法。

Result: 在22个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ISER在11种基线方法中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ISER通过集成表示和基于相似性的评分有效解决了异常检测中的关键挑战，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习、分布式计算和通信的紧密集成首次实现了在超低功耗硬件上以最先进精度进行训练。

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着算法决策的普及，系统容易受到战略代理人的操纵。现有研究表明分类器弃权能提高准确性，但需要探索其在战略分类环境中的影响。

Method: 使用Stackelberg博弈模型，决策者作为领导者首先宣布决策策略，战略代理人作为跟随者随后操纵特征以获得期望结果。

Result: 最优弃权策略确保决策者效用不劣于非弃权设置，弃权还能作为操纵的威慑，使不合格代理人更难通过操纵获得积极结果。

Conclusion: 弃权是减少算法决策系统中战略行为负面影响的有价值工具，既能提高准确性，又能阻止操纵。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Result: 在FAQ响应优化、热稳定蛋白质搜索和量子电路设计三个任务上验证了方法，在线微调显著提高了样本效率，对计算效率影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ToSFiT方法通过变分Thompson采样实现了与标准方法相当的强保证，验证了仔细适应后验最大概率原则的重要性。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 邻近核方法能够有效处理不完整数据的相似性度量问题，在保持计算效率的同时提升性能。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

TL;DR: 提出Generalist框架，通过将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务由专门的基学习器处理，然后通过参数插值形成全局学习器，缓解对抗训练中自然精度下降和跨攻击鲁棒性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练虽然是最有效的防御方法，但在实际应用中存在两个主要限制：自然精度显著下降，以及在不同范数约束下攻击间的鲁棒性转移效果差。

Method: 将整体泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务分配给专门的基学习器；在训练后期通过参数插值形成全局学习器，并定期将全局参数重新分配给基学习器以防止优化轨迹偏离共享目标。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验表明，Generalist实现了更低的泛化误差，并显著缓解了与基线方法相比的权衡问题。

Conclusion: Generalist为未来开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了一个有前景的步骤。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

Conclusion: 这些发现为在在线强化学习中应用Transformer提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于预测市场的新框架，通过考虑历史表现、适应时变条件、允许自由进出的机制，解决数据所有权和竞争利益约束下的预测协作问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然数据可用性和准确预测需求都在增加，但利益相关者之间的协作常受数据所有权和竞争利益限制。现有合作博弈理论框架不够通用，需要更灵活的协作机制。

Method: 设计预测市场，使用稳健回归模型学习最优预测组合并处理缺失提交，引入考虑样本内外表现的收益分配机制，满足多种经济特性。

Result: 通过模拟和真实数据案例研究，证明了所提市场设计的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该预测市场框架为数据所有权和竞争约束下的预测协作提供了可行解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

### [227] [Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391)
*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于图神经网络(GNN)的新方法，用于近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，相比传统精确计算和蒙特卡洛采样方法，实现了数量级的速度提升和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值计算在网络安全、基础设施规划等应用中至关重要，但精确计算在超过约20个代理时变得不可行，而蒙特卡洛方法样本复杂度高且无法跨网络配置迁移知识。

Method: 将问题构建为图级预测任务，使用图神经网络(GNN)直接从网络拓扑和控制结构中学习代理影响力的通用模式，比较了GAT、GINE和EdgeConv三种先进GNN架构。

Result: 在包含200,000个图的大规模合成数据集上验证，训练后的GNN模型实现了高保真度的Banzhaf值近似，相比精确和基于采样的方法实现了数量级的速度提升，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了GNN作为复杂网络系统可扩展合作博弈论分析的实用工具，能够准确预测具有不同结构特性的全新网络的Banzhaf值，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

*Yuxin Wang,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Maresa Schröder,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个假设宽松的框架，用于评估生存分析中条件平均治疗效果(CATE)估计在面临删失偏差时的稳健性，通过部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验中高达一半的患者因副作用或其他原因提前退出，当退出是信息性时（即依赖于生存时间），会引入删失偏差，导致治疗效果估计也产生偏差。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界，开发一种新的元学习器，利用任意机器学习模型估计边界，具有双重稳健性和准oracle效率的理论性质。

Result: 通过数值实验和癌症药物试验应用证明了元学习器的实用价值，能够识别在信息性删失下治疗仍然有效的患者亚组。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个实用工具，用于评估在存在删失的情况下估计治疗效果的稳健性，从而促进生存数据在医学和流行病学中证据生成的可靠使用。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种从LWIR数据合成SWIR图像的方法，并开发了融合RGB、LWIR和合成SWIR的多模态融合框架，在恶劣能见度条件下显著提升了场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决恶劣能见度条件下场景理解的挑战，传统RGB和热红外融合方法在存在大气干扰或光照不足时效果有限，而SWIR成像具有穿透大气干扰和更好材料区分能力，但缺乏公开SWIR数据集限制了其发展。

Method: 使用先进的对比度增强技术从现有LWIR数据合成SWIR图像，提出多模态融合框架，集成合成SWIR、LWIR和RGB模态，采用优化的编码器-解码器神经网络架构，包含模态特定编码器和softmax门控融合头。

Result: 在多个公共RGB-LWIR基准测试和私有真实RGB-MWIR-SWIR数据集上的实验表明，合成SWIR增强的融合框架提高了融合图像质量（对比度、边缘定义、结构保真度），同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在监视和自主系统中具有重要的实际应用潜力，为恶劣能见度条件下的场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaLog是一个轻量级自适应系统，通过消除特征级冗余数据和优化异构行为存储，显著减少移动应用中用户行为日志的存储成本，同时保持模型推理精度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在移动应用中的普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性下降和应用卸载率上升。现有工业实践存在特征冗余和存储稀疏的问题。

Method: 1) 将特征级冗余数据消除建模为超图中的最大加权匹配问题，提出分层算法；2) 使用虚拟哈希属性设计将异构行为分布到少量日志文件中；3) 设计增量更新机制以适应动态用户行为模式。

Result: 在真实用户数据上的评估显示，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%到44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用）。

Conclusion: AdaLog为更广泛采用设备端机器学习提供了更高效的数据基础，解决了移动应用中用户行为日志的存储瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过正交变换对齐两个嵌入模型，使得它们可以互操作。作者证明了如果成对点积近似保持，则存在一个等距变换可以紧密对齐两个嵌入集，并提出了Procrustes后处理方法来实现这种对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分别训练的嵌入模型虽然编码了稳定信息，但缺乏互操作性，这给模型重训练、部分模型升级和多模态搜索等实际应用带来了挑战。

Method: 使用Procrustes后处理方法，通过正交变换对齐两个嵌入集，同时保持每个嵌入空间的几何结构。

Result: 实验证明该方法在三个应用中有效：保持重训练兼容性、组合不同模型进行文本检索、改进混合模态搜索，并在混合模态搜索中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过正交变换对齐嵌入模型可以实现互操作性，同时保持原始嵌入空间的几何特性，为解决实际应用中的兼容性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 在肿瘤学中，实验数据通常稀疏且仅包含少数时间点的肿瘤体积数据，传统方法难以准确建模组合疗法的时变相互作用。

Method: 扩展物理信息神经网络，将观察到的生物约束作为正则化项嵌入损失函数，通过嵌入从动力学系统先验信息导出的归纳偏置来改进PINN算法。

Conclusion: 该方法在均方误差、平均绝对误差和平均绝对百分比误差等指标上表现出强收敛性，为肿瘤治疗动力学建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Conclusion: 这种混合方法为预测建模提供了一个平衡且多功能的工具，有效解决了模糊系统中可解释性与准确性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

<details>

Motivation: 高层建筑会导致停车位GPS点漂移，且低成本GPS设备本身存在定位误差，需要从大量停车位中无监督地校正少数错误的GPS点。

Method: 基于停车位与道路平行的物理约束，提出无监督低秩方法，在统一框架中同时进行GPS点误差校正和对齐。

Result: 广泛实验证明该方法能有效解决实际问题，对任何类型的GPS点误差都简单有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为停车管理、停车政策和城市发展等应用提供了准确的停车位GPS定位数据。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

Motivation: 证明多项式非负性是NP难问题，传统SOS方法需要求解维度随单项式基大小二次增长的SDP，计算成本高昂。现有方法主要关注减少单项式基规模，但缺乏学习方法的探索。

Conclusion: 该方法为SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新的见解，展示了学习增强方法在复杂优化问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Motivation: 概率预测的校准对于可靠的机器学习至关重要，但标准训练程序如何产生良好校准模型的理解仍然不足。

Method: 基于优化误差、正则化强度和Rademacher复杂度建立了平滑校准误差的有限样本泛化界，并在再生核希尔伯特空间中实例化了该理论。

Result: 实验验证了理论保证，表明L2正则化ERM可以提供良好校准的模型，无需增强或后处理重新校准。

Conclusion: 标准L2正则化经验风险最小化本身就具备控制校准误差的能力，为模型校准提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source
code to reproduce all experiments is available at

Motivation: 平均收益最优性在MDP中过于渐近，结合即时损失度量形成了偏差最优性层次结构，需要研究如何识别这些最优性顺序的策略。

Result: 确定了具有唯一贝尔曼最优策略的MDP类别，这类MDP的识别算法可以在有限时间内停止，且与最优性顺序无关。

Conclusion: 提出的学习算法具有渐近零错误概率，停止规则在可能时能在有限时间内触发，为偏差最优性策略识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further
incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias
optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

*Zexin Wang,Lin Shi,Haoyu Wu,Junru Luo,Xiangzeng Kong,Jun Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP框架的多模态癫痫检测模型DistilCLIP-EEG，整合EEG信号和文本描述，通过知识蒸馏训练轻量级学生模型，在多个数据集上达到超过97%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法仅依赖单模态EEG信号，忽略了多模态信息的潜在优势，需要开发能整合EEG和文本描述的综合癫痫检测方法。

Method: 基于CLIP框架，使用Conformer架构的EEG编码器和可学习BERT（BERT-LP）作为文本编码器，在共享潜在空间进行跨模态表示学习，并通过知识蒸馏训练更紧凑的学生模型。

Result: 在TUSZ、AUBMC和CHB-MIT数据集上，教师和学生模型准确率均超过97%，F1分数均高于0.94，学生模型参数量和大小约为教师模型的58.1%。

Conclusion: 该模型在EEG癫痫检测中表现出色，为资源受限环境部署轻量级模型奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在ε-局部差分隐私(ε-LDP)模型下，基于KL正则化的人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)的离线和在线设置。在离线设置中，提出了基于悲观主义原则的算法，并推导出新的次优性差距；在在线设置中，首次理论研究了带LDP的KL正则化RLHF问题，设计了乐观算法并获得对数遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在保护人类偏好标签隐私(ε-LDP)的前提下，如何有效进行RLHF模型对齐，这是大语言模型对齐中广泛使用的目标函数。

Method: 离线设置：基于悲观主义原则设计算法；在线设置：基于乐观主义设计算法，使用函数空间和eluder维度变体。

Result: 离线：获得次优性差距$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$并证明其最优性；在线：获得遗憾界$O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T)/(e^\epsilon-1)^2)$，同时首次分析了无隐私的在线KL正则化RLHF。

Conclusion: 成功设计了在LDP约束下RLHF的离线和在线算法，提供了理论保证并验证了有效性，为隐私保护的模型对齐提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在移动设备上在线持续合并LoRA适配器的数据无关且计算高效的方法，解决存储限制下的多任务适配器管理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备部署LLM时使用LoRA适配器支持多样下游任务，但存储容量有限。现有模型合并技术无法应对LoRA增量交付的场景，需要在线持续合并新LoRA同时保持旧任务性能。

Method: 提出数据无关且计算高效的策略，在新LoRA可用时选择和合并适配器，设备仅能存储有限数量的适配器。

Result: 在真实世界任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在存储预算和设备计算限制下优于其他替代策略。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了移动设备上LoRA适配器的在线持续合并问题，在资源受限环境下保持多任务性能。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

TL;DR: ProtoTopic是一种基于原型网络的主题模型，专门用于医学论文摘要的主题生成，在数据有限的情况下表现优于传统主题建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模技术在医学文本上表现不佳，特别是在医疗领域某些主题文档数量较少的情况下。

Method: 使用原型网络构建主题模型，通过计算输入数据点与原型表示之间的距离进行预测，特别适用于低数据或少样本学习场景。

Result: 与文献中使用的两种主题建模基线相比，ProtoTopic在主题连贯性和多样性方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: 该模型能够在数据有限的情况下生成医学相关主题，证明了原型网络在主题建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展传统在线凸优化(OCO)的视野，考虑多目标场景，其中存在K个不同的损失函数序列，需要设计能够同时跟踪多个序列的算法。

Method: 在i.i.d.输入设置下，提出结合Hedge算法和在线梯度下降(OGD)的简单算法，通过简单的证明分析其性能。

Result: 证明了所提算法的期望min-max遗憾为O(√(T log K))，表明该算法能够有效跟踪多个损失函数序列。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在多目标在线凸优化问题中表现良好，通过简单的组合方法实现了接近最优的min-max遗憾界。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

TL;DR: 提出DOLFIN方法，结合Vision Transformers和低秩适配器，在联邦持续学习中实现高效稳定的新任务学习，同时最小化通信开销和防止遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦持续学习方法在平衡性能、隐私保护和通信效率方面面临挑战，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用分布式在线LoRA（低秩适配器）结合Vision Transformers，采用DualGradient Projection Memory防止遗忘，最小化通信开销。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-R、ImageNet-A和CUB-200数据集上，DOLFIN在两种Dirichlet异构设置下均优于六个强基线方法，在最终平均准确率上表现更优，同时保持相同的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交低秩适配器为联邦环境下的隐私保护持续学习提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across
multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges
balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We
introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters
designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments.
Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet
heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in
final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal
low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for
privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了选择性对抗攻击对LLM基准测试的影响，发现即使微小的语义等效扰动也能显著改变模型在MMLU基准上的相对排名，挑战了排行榜评估的公平性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试易受语义等效对抗扰动的影响，但现有研究主要关注对所有模型产生同等影响的攻击，缺乏对选择性攻击（即仅针对特定模型性能）的研究。

Method: 使用TextAttack框架中的标准攻击方法，开发了选择性评估协议、定制约束条件以提高攻击选择性，并提出了基于代理LLM的选择性扰动生成流程。

Result: 实证发现选择性对抗攻击确实存在，能够实质性改变模型在MMLU基准上的相对排名，影响评估的公平性和透明度。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要采用扰动感知的报告和鲁棒性诊断来改进LLM评估，即使是细微的编辑也可能改变比较判断。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在先进工艺节点中，功率、性能和面积优化变得复杂且具有挑战性。机器学习和设计技术协同优化面临训练数据不足和设计流程周转时间长的限制。

Method: 提出ArtNet人工网表生成器，该方法能够复制关键拓扑特征，生成与目标参数匹配的逼真人工数据集，支持更广泛的设计空间探索。

Result: 在CNN基DRV预测中，ArtNet数据增强使F1分数比仅使用原始数据集提高了0.16；在DTCO场景中，ArtNet生成的mini-brains与目标全规模块设计的PPA匹配度达到97.94%。

Conclusion: ArtNet通过生成多样化的人工训练数据有效解决了ML和DTCO中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了PPA优化的效率和效果。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

Motivation: 传统通道选择方法难以处理SEEG信号的大量输入通道及其异质性，且缺乏有意义的可解释性。

Method: 提出EEGChaT模块，引入通道聚合令牌(CATs)跨通道聚合信息，利用改进的注意力展开技术计算可量化的通道重要性分数。

Result: 在DuIN数据集上评估，EEGChaT与现有分类模型结合能持续提高解码准确率，获得高达17%的绝对增益，且通道权重与人工选择通道有显著重叠。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是处理高维SEEG分析中通道选择的有效且可泛化解决方案，既提升性能又提供神经信号相关性的见解。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Result: 在3D心脏电动力学建模任务中验证，相比现有方法显著提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效整合领域特定物理约束和几何先验，为复杂几何域上的时空动态系统建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私法规和安全要求，联邦学习中需要能够有效且及时地移除客户贡献，但现有方法需要多轮通信，导致模型在清除过程中不可用，影响系统服务。

Method: 采用任务算术和神经正切核技术，开发快速移除客户影响的创新解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的基于任务算术和神经正切核的方法为联邦学习中的客户贡献移除提供了高效解决方案，满足了隐私保护和实时服务的双重需求。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

Motivation: 现有GNN架构表达能力有限，且更强大的架构通常计算成本高昂。需要开发既具强表达能力又保持计算效率的图神经网络。

Method: 基于Chiba和Nishizeki的经典三角形计数算法，提出EB-1WL边缘着色细化测试和EB-GNN架构，在消息传递过程中显式利用三角形结构。

Result: EB-1WL比1-WL显著更具表达能力；EB-GNN在保持计算效率的同时，性能大幅优于简单MPNN，并与任务专用GNN保持竞争力。

Conclusion: EB-GNN是一个高效通用的图神经网络架构，在表达能力和计算效率之间实现了良好平衡，为图学习任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding
GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle
counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during
message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly
more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient
general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and
remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more

TL;DR: 该论文为经典非线性降维方法构建了神经解码器框架，实现了双向映射，并探索了在降维空间中应用扩散模型生成数据，但发现这些方法在重建和生成质量上不如端到端的自编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典非线性降维方法如t-SNE、Isomap和LLE只能单向降维，无法将低维嵌入映射回原始高维空间，这限制了它们在生成应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了构建神经解码器架构的系统框架，为经典NLDR方法实现双向映射，并在此基础上实现基于扩散的生成过程，直接在学习的流形空间中操作。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的实验表明，解码器能成功重建数据，但质量不如端到端优化的自编码器；流形约束的扩散模型生成样本质量较差，说明经典NLDR嵌入的离散稀疏特性不适合生成模型所需的连续插值。

Conclusion: 为主要为可视化和分析设计的经典NLDR方法添加生成能力存在固有挑战，这些方法的嵌入特性与生成模型的连续插值需求不匹配。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

Motivation: 现有量子储层计算研究主要针对单变量信号，且忽视了近期硬件的实际约束，需要开发适用于多元时间序列预测且考虑硬件限制的量子储层计算方法。

Method: 使用注入和记忆量子比特配对，采用适用于当前设备连接和深度的Trotter化最近邻横向场Ising演化，构建门电路量子储层计算框架。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上分别获得0.0087和0.0036的MSE，性能与经典储层计算相当，在某些情况下优于学习型RNN；在IBM Heron R2上保持准确性，在ENSO上甚至优于无噪声模拟器。

Conclusion: 基于门电路的量子储层计算在NISQ硬件上对多元时间序列预测具有实用性，设备噪声在某些情况下可作为隐式正则化器，需要系统研究硬件噪声何时以及如何有益于量子储层计算输出。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型评估中的挑战，包括基准数据集代表性不足、时空评估缺失、信息泄露风险以及外部冲击导致的全局模式记忆问题，呼吁开发更稳健的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型的发展，现有评估方法面临多重挑战，包括训练数据完整性难以保证、基准数据集代表性不足、存在信息泄露风险等，这些问题可能导致性能评估失真。

Method: 通过调查现有TSFM评估实践，识别出数据分区混乱、时空评估缺失、信息泄露风险等关键问题，并分析这些问题对模型性能评估的影响。

Result: 研究发现现有评估方法存在广泛的数据分区混淆，可能导致性能估计膨胀和全局知识错误传递到局部时间序列，同时缺乏对时空维度的充分评估。

Conclusion: 需要开发更稳健的评估方法学，包括在真正样本外未来数据上进行评估，以维护TSFM评估的完整性，避免重蹈LLM和传统时间序列基准测试的覆辙。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

Motivation: 类别不平衡问题导致分类器偏向多数类，传统方法仅使用多数类分布来近似少数类统计会产生过泛化问题。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络保持不平衡数据结构，通过分布校准策略从编码器提取的特征向量生成合成样本，利用邻近区域数据点分布来校准参数。

Result: 在多种图像、文本和表格数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比多个基线和最先进技术获得了更优的分类性能。

Conclusion: RCS方法通过分布校准有效解决了类别不平衡问题，在多个领域数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Motivation: 对角预条件器作为二阶优化器的近似方法，在深度学习训练中显示出加速潜力。需要系统比较基于Adam和Gauss-Newton的两种主流对角预条件方法。

Method: 通过二次目标和逻辑回归的理论分析，考虑预条件基选择和梯度噪声两个关键因素。在完整批次和随机设置下比较Adam、GN^{-1}和GN^{-1/2}的性能。

Result: 理论分析显示：在完整批次设置中，无论选择何种基，都存在Adam优于GN^{-1}和GN^{-1/2}的情况；在随机设置中，对于高斯数据假设下的线性回归，Adam与GN^{-1/2}行为相似。

Conclusion: Adam和Gauss-Newton对角预条件方法各有优势，选择取决于具体设置。理论结果在凸和非凸目标上得到实证支持。

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Conclusion: InfoRM和IBL框架有效缓解了奖励过优化问题，MOP提供了量化评估方法，为RLHF提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

Motivation: 现有的大规模环境并行化方法虽然加速了训练时间，但仍需要大量环境交互才能达到理想性能。结构良好的表示可以改善深度强化学习的泛化能力和样本效率。

Method: 提出单纯形嵌入作为轻量级表示层，将嵌入约束到单纯形结构中，产生稀疏离散特征来稳定批评家自举和增强策略梯度。

Result: 在FastTD3、FastSAC和PPO算法上应用单纯形嵌入，在多种连续和离散控制环境中一致提高了样本效率和最终性能，且不损失运行速度。

Conclusion: 单纯形嵌入通过几何归纳偏置有效改善了强化学习代理的表示学习，在保持运行效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

Motivation: 千米尺度天气数据对实际应用至关重要，但传统天气模拟计算成本高。深度学习模型提供了更快的替代方案，但其可靠性仍受质疑，因为评估往往基于标准机器学习指标而非大气物理学的洞察。

Method: 论文对最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试，引入物理启发的诊断方法来评估性能，特别关注地理泛化和物理一致性。提出使用功率谱密度损失函数来改进小尺度物理结构的重建。

Result: 实验显示，即使在欧洲中部训练良好的模型（如CorrDiff），也难以泛化到伊比利亚半岛、摩洛哥或斯堪的纳维亚等其他地区。模型还无法准确捕捉从预测速度场导出的二阶变量（如散度和涡度）。

Conclusion: 深度学习天气降尺度模型在地理泛化和物理一致性方面存在显著挑战。提出的功率谱密度损失函数能经验性地改善地理泛化能力，但需要进一步研究来确保物理一致的预测。

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Conclusion: TGPS方法通过张量分解和一维高斯过程建模，有效解决了传统PDE求解器的可扩展性和效率问题，为大规模PDE求解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T3former是一种新颖的拓扑时序Transformer，通过滑动窗口拓扑和谱描述符作为主要token，结合描述符注意力机制，在时序图分类任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图分类在网络安全、脑连接分析等领域很重要，但现有方法存在丢失细粒度时序信息、难以处理长程依赖、过平滑和过压缩等问题。

Method: 使用滑动窗口拓扑和谱描述符作为主要token，通过专门的描述符注意力机制进行集成，避免刚性离散化，实现原则性的跨模态融合。

Result: 在动态社交网络、脑功能连接数据集和交通网络等多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，并具有时序和结构扰动下的稳定性理论保证。

Conclusion: 结合拓扑和谱洞察能够推进时序图学习的前沿，T3former展示了这种方法的强大能力。

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论的"不可战胜"对抗攻击方法，通过率失真理论随机改变智能体对转移核的观测，使其在训练中获得极少真实信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性对抗攻击可被智能体通过反转攻击来防御，需要研究更强大的攻击方法以提高RL系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 应用率失真信息论方法，随机改变智能体对转移核等属性的观测，限制其获取真实信息的能力。

Result: 推导了接收智能体奖励遗憾的信息论下界，展示了率失真攻击对最先进模型基和无模型算法的影响。

Conclusion: 该信息论方法可扩展到其他类型对抗攻击，如状态观测攻击，提供了一种理论上有保证的攻击框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.

### [269] [From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12864)
*Imran Khan*

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种零样本元提示技术，通过结构化认知模式解决LLMs的规则僵化问题，显著提升人类对齐度至95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs作为智能体推理引擎存在规则僵化问题，即过度遵循显式规则而忽视人类常识和意图，这阻碍了可信自主智能体的构建。

Method: RID框架通过结构化认知模式，让模型解构任务、分类规则、权衡冲突结果并最终决策，是一种低计算成本的元提示技术。

Result: 在20个需要细微判断的场景中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链提示(75%)。

Conclusion: RID框架提供了一种实用、可访问且有效的方法，引导LLMs从字面指令遵循转向目标导向推理，为更可靠实用的AI智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

*Wei Fan,Wenlin Yao,Zheng Li,Feng Yao,Xin Liu,Liang Qiu,Qingyu Yin,Yangqiu Song,Bing Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPlanner是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过基于熵的令牌级优势塑造和选择性样本级优势加权，有效提升深度研究代理的规划能力，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但未系统优化规划阶段。研究发现，在普通强化学习下，规划令牌的熵显著高于其他动作令牌，揭示了未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架：1）使用基于熵的令牌级优势塑造，为高熵令牌分配更大的更新；2）选择性加权规划密集型rollouts的样本级优势。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并在显著降低的训练预算下实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统优化规划阶段，有效增强了语言模型的规划能力，为复杂任务的长时程规划提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个基于形式化方法评估LLM具身智能体物理安全性的框架，通过语义、规划和轨迹三个层次进行多级验证，使用时序逻辑精确描述安全需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观的LLM判断，无法精确评估LLM具身智能体在物理环境中的安全性，需要建立形式化的验证框架。

Method: 采用多级验证流程：语义层将自然语言安全需求形式化为时序逻辑公式；规划层验证高层动作计划；轨迹层合并执行轨迹进行最终安全检查。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估多个LLM具身智能体，发现之前方法忽略的安全违规，并揭示其失效模式。

Conclusion: 通过时序逻辑形式化物理安全需求并在多层级应用验证方法，Sentinel为系统评估LLM具身智能体提供了严谨基础。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于微调大语言模型的框架，用于从交通事故叙述中自动识别驾驶员危险行为，解决了人工编码不一致的问题，并在不平衡数据场景下表现优于传统机器学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两车碰撞占交通事故的70%，但驾驶员危险行为数据在大规模数据库中由于人工编码不一致且耗时，可靠性有限。需要自动化的方法来提高DHA分类的有效性和可解释性。

Method: 使用MTCF五年两车碰撞数据，对Llama 3.2 1B模型进行微调，并与随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost和神经网络等传统分类器进行基准比较。开发了概率推理方法来分析模型输出变化。

Result: 微调后的LLM总体准确率达到80%，优于所有基线模型，在不平衡数据场景下表现尤为突出。通过反事实分析发现：驾驶员分心会增加"一般不安全驾驶"概率；双方分心会最大化"双方危险行为"概率；青少年驾驶员会显著增加"速度和停车违规"概率。

Conclusion: 该框架和分析方法为大规模自动DHA检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预提供了新的机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 本文主张将时间序列分析重新构想为基于LLM的推理任务，强调因果结构和可解释性，而非仅依赖数值回归能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列分析依赖静态基准测试，无法适应现实世界中政策变化、人类行为调整和突发事件等动态环境。现有LLM方法大多忽视其深层推理潜力。

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定义为推理任务，利用LLM的多模态输入整合能力，强调因果结构和可解释性分析。

Result: 通过这种转变，使时间序列分析更接近人类对齐的理解，在复杂现实环境中提供透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考如何有效利用LLM进行时间序列分析，将其从数值回归转向因果推理，以实现更透明、可解释的洞察。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于偏好的奖励修复(PBRR)框架，通过从人类偏好中学习一个加性的、状态转移相关的修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，解决奖励函数与真实目标不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不匹配，导致策略不协调；而从零开始学习奖励函数需要大量人类偏好数据，成本高昂。

Method: PBRR框架通过目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，识别关键状态转移并学习加性修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格域中证明PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好学习RL方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于从零学习奖励函数或使用其他方法修改代理奖励函数的基线方法，且需要更少的偏好数据。

Conclusion: PBRR能有效利用现有代理奖励函数，通过少量偏好数据学习修正项，获得与真实目标协调的高性能策略。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含欲望生成和目标管理的情绪认知框架，使基于LLM的智能体能够模拟人类的情感状态和决策过程，显著提升了智能体在复杂社会系统中的生态效度和人类行为相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体在情感认知方面存在严重限制：无法模拟连接虚拟与现实服务的有限理性；缺乏经过实证验证的将情绪嵌入智能体决策架构的整合机制。

Method: 构建了一个情绪认知框架，包含状态演化、欲望生成、目标优化、决策生成和行动执行的完整决策过程，并在专有多智能体交互环境中实现了该框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，受该框架控制的智能体不仅表现出与其情绪状态一致的行为，而且在与其他类型智能体的比较评估中，展现出更优越的生态效度，其决策结果显著更接近人类行为模式。

Conclusion: 所提出的情绪认知框架成功实现了基于LLM的智能体与人类之间的情绪对齐，为复杂社会系统中的虚拟人类模拟提供了更真实的情感认知能力。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Motivation: 虽然链式思维提示和多代理系统能提高复杂任务性能，但对所有问题都应用深度推理计算成本过高。

Method: 小型LLM先生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证。如果正确则直接采用，否则大型LLM进行深度推理。

Result: 在简单问题上，大型LLM的计算成本降低超过50%，准确率损失可忽略，同时在复杂任务上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统能有效平衡计算效率和任务性能，为LLM应用提供了实用的成本优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

Motivation: 当前AI代理无法在测试时动态学习复杂技能，在陌生环境中表现不佳，这严重限制了它们的实际应用价值。

Method: 提出了EvoTest进化测试时学习框架，包含两个角色：执行游戏的Actor代理和分析游戏记录并提出改进配置的Evolver代理，通过进化整个代理系统来提升性能。

Result: EvoTest在J-TTL基准上持续提升性能，优于反思、仅记忆和在线微调等方法，是唯一能够赢得两个游戏的方法。

Conclusion: EvoTest框架有效解决了AI代理在测试时学习的问题，为开发更实用的AI代理提供了新方向。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,

function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of

*Weiqi Guo,Guanjun Liu,Ziyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了状态-动作联合攻击(SAJA)框架，通过协同利用状态和动作扰动来增强对多智能体深度强化学习模型的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究只关注状态攻击或动作攻击，没有考虑如何有效联合两者。简单地随机扰动状态和动作无法发挥它们的协同效应。

Method: SAJA框架包含两个阶段：状态攻击阶段使用多步梯度上升方法结合演员网络和评论家网络计算对抗状态；动作攻击阶段基于扰动状态使用评论家网络生成最终对抗动作。还添加了衡量扰动动作与原始动作距离的启发式正则化器。

Result: 在Multi-Agent Particle Environment中的评估表明，SAJA比仅状态或仅动作攻击效果更好且更隐蔽，现有防御方法无法抵御其攻击。

Conclusion: SAJA框架有效利用了状态和动作扰动的协同效应，为多智能体深度强化学习模型的鲁棒性研究提供了新的攻击视角。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Method: 从博弈论视角重新审视合作合理化，提出PORAT方法，通过逐步引入策略干预来解决合作博弈过程中的均衡问题

Result: 在9个真实世界数据集和2个合成设置上验证，PORAT比现有最优方法性能提升高达8.1%

Conclusion: PORAT通过博弈论方法有效解决了合理化中的模式崩溃问题，引导模型达到更优的解决方案状态

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 研究旨在探究大型语言模型如何理解因果关系，以及它们能否发现连接原因和结果的中间因果步骤，特别是在论证情境中的机制性因果推理能力。

Method: 在诊断性评估框架中，指导9个LLM为给定的因果对生成所有可能的中间因果步骤，这些因果对来自气候变化论证研究的最新资源。

Result: LLMs在生成的因果步骤数量和粒度上存在差异，它们通常对生成的因果链中的中间连接具有自我一致性和信心，但主要依赖关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理。人类评估确认了生成链条的逻辑一致性和完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究的基线因果链发现方法、诊断评估见解以及带有因果链的基准数据集为推进论证情境中隐式机制性因果推理的未来工作奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Motivation: 准确评估移动网络覆盖和识别服务弱区对提升用户体验至关重要，传统方法难以在复杂城市环境中精确定位信号问题。

Method: 使用OC-SVM算法建模覆盖边界，基于众包地理位置数据进行小区级覆盖分析，并聚合到站点级，同时分析服务丢失报告识别弱区。

Result: 该框架能准确绘制移动网络覆盖图，特别是在复杂城市环境中有效识别和量化信号弱区。

Conclusion: 提出的基于OC-SVM和众包数据的框架为移动网络覆盖分析和弱区识别提供了有效解决方案，尤其适用于城市环境。

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew)方法，利用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励信号，无需训练即可在数学推理任务中超越现有训练免费奖励方法，甚至优于多数训练过的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型需要大量标注数据和昂贵训练，而训练免费方法如LLM-as-a-Judge虽有效但置信度作为奖励的概念尚未系统研究。

Method: 系统研究CRew方法，使用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励代理，特别适用于封闭式任务；并提出CRew-DPO训练策略，结合置信度得分和正确性信号构建偏好数据。

Result: 在MATH500和RewardMATH基准测试中，CRew优于现有训练免费奖励方法，甚至超过多数训练过的奖励模型；CRew得分与模型实际推理性能强相关；CRew能有效筛选高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: CRew是一种简单而强大的训练免费奖励方法，CRew-DPO进一步提升了模型的判断能力，持续优于现有自训练方法。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs

explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型快速发展，其推理过程可能变得难以被较弱代理或人类理解，这会削弱可解释性和监督能力。需要开发方法使强模型能产生对弱协作方保持可理解性的解决方案。

Method: 引入tandem training强化学习范式：在训练强模型时，随机从冻结的弱模型中采样token来接管推理过程，只有当强模型的行动和推理过程能被弱模型继续时，才能成功完成推理任务。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理任务中，tandem training可靠地教会模型放弃专业术语，使语言适应较弱伙伴，同时保持任务准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可被较弱代理审计的AI系统提供了一条有前景的路径，对人类-AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义。

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Motivation: 当前构建辅助代理的方法往往鼓励代理独立完成任务而非真正帮助人类实现目标，且需要昂贵的人工反馈。需要一种仅用离线数据就能训练出真正辅助人类的方法。

Method: 提出Empower方法，通过最大化人类赋权（影响环境的能力）来调优语言模型，仅需离线文本数据，无需额外人工反馈。

Result: 用户研究中78%的参与者偏好Empower助手（p=0.015），接受率提高31%，建议减少38%。在模拟编程环境中，Empower将模拟程序员在挑战性编程问题上的成功率平均提高192%。

Conclusion: Empower提供了一个仅使用离线数据就能大规模构建有用对齐AI代理的框架，无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Conclusion: 控制理论护栏为当前标记-阻止式护栏提供了原则性的动态替代方案，能够更有效地确保AI代理的安全性。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Conclusion: Hard2Verify基准为评估前沿步骤级验证器提供了严格标准，揭示了开源与闭源验证器之间的性能差距，并为理解验证机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.

Motivation: 理解累积文化进化中产生创新的认知过程，特别是语义知识在创新生成中的作用。

Method: 使用基于代理的文化进化模型和大规模行为实验（N=1,243），测试参与者在组合物品进行创新任务中的表现。

Result: 语义知识与社会学习协同增强创新；缺乏语义知识的参与者表现不优于随机水平，即使有社会学习可用，且依赖浅层探索策略。

Conclusion: 语义知识是使人类累积文化成为可能的关键认知过程。

Abstract: Cumulative cultural evolution enables human societies to generate
increasingly complex knowledge and technology over generations. While social
learning transmits innovations between individuals and generations, the
cognitive processes that generate these innovations remain poorly understood.
Here, we demonstrate that semantic knowledge-structured associations between
concepts and their functions-provides cognitive scaffolding for cumulative
innovation by guiding exploration toward plausible and meaningful actions. We
tested this hypothesis using a cultural evolutionary agent-based model and a
large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243), in which individuals performed
a task requiring the combination of items into novel innovations. Across both
approaches, semantic knowledge and social learning interact synergistically to
enhance innovation. Behaviorally, participants without access to semantic
knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social learning was
available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies. These findings suggest
that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative
culture.

TL;DR: KVCOMM是一个无需训练的多智能体LLM推理框架，通过重用KV缓存和对齐缓存偏移来解决多智能体系统中上下文重复处理导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM系统在处理复杂语言任务时需要智能体间的通信协调，但会因重复处理重叠上下文而产生大量开销。现有的KV缓存技术无法直接应用于多智能体场景，因为不同智能体的前缀上下文存在差异。

Method: 提出KVCOMM框架，通过引用锚点池来估计和调整共享内容的KV缓存，对齐不同前缀上下文下的缓存偏移。锚点池在线维护更新，能够动态适应不同的用户请求和上下文结构。

Result: 在检索增强生成、数学推理和协作编码等多种多智能体任务中，KVCOMM实现了超过70%的缓存重用率，且无质量下降。在五智能体设置下，当每个全连接智能体处理1K输入token时，实现了7.8倍加速，将TTFT从约430ms降低到约55ms。

Conclusion: KVCOMM有效解决了多智能体LLM系统中的上下文重复处理问题，显著提升了推理效率，为多智能体系统的实际部署提供了可行的优化方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for
complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination
among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from
repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical
pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full
context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to
inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution
for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes
remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to
diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify
that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents.
To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables
efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning
cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM
estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of
cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under
varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing
dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM
achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including
retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks,
all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent
receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a
five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard
prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.

Conclusion: ARS是一个可扩展的、社区驱动的传统拼车替代方案，能够将个体行为与集体城市可持续性目标对齐。

Abstract: Urban mobility faces persistent challenges of congestion and fuel
consumption, specifically when people choose a private, point-to-point commute
option. Profit-driven ride-sharing platforms prioritize revenue over fairness
and sustainability. This paper introduces Altruistic Ride-Sharing (ARS), a
decentralized, peer-to-peer mobility framework where participants alternate
between driver and rider roles based on altruism points rather than monetary
incentives. The system integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADDPG)
for dynamic ride-matching, game-theoretic equilibrium guarantees for fairness,
and a population model to sustain long-term balance. Using real-world New York
City taxi data, we demonstrate that ARS reduces travel distance and emissions,
increases vehicle utilization, and promotes equitable participation compared to
both no-sharing and optimization-based baselines. These results establish ARS
as a scalable, community-driven alternative to conventional ride-sharing,
aligning individual behavior with collective urban sustainability goals.

*Shota Takayama,Katsuhide Fujita*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了AOAD-MAT模型，通过显式考虑智能体决策顺序来改进多智能体强化学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习模型虽然提升了性能，但没有显式考虑智能体决策顺序的重要性

Method: 使用基于Transformer的actor-critic架构，动态调整智能体动作序列，引入预测下一个行动智能体的子任务，并集成到PPO损失函数中

Result: 在StarCraft多智能体挑战和Multi-Agent MuJoCo基准测试中，AOAD-MAT模型优于现有的MAT和其他基线模型

Conclusion: 调整智能体动作决策顺序在多智能体强化学习中具有有效性

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of
multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL
models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep
Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging
sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance
performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in
which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action
Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which
agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence
of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and
predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a
Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the
sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL
architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next
agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss
function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential
decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive
experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo
benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model
outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the
effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.

*Sameha Alshakhsi,Ala Yankouskaya,Dena Al-Thani,Raian Ali*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于protégé效应的干预措施对管理数字压力的效果，发现将认知参与转化为行为改变具有挑战性，特别是在数字习惯和社会强化压力源的背景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索protégé效应（通过教学来学习）是否也能支持新行为的获取，特别是在数字压力管理方面。

Method: 将137名中度到高度数字压力的参与者分为四组：被动protégé组（提供教学材料）、主动protégé组（需自行搜索准备教学内容）、数字素养组（接收类似内容和测验）和对照组。为期三周，每次聚焦一个数字压力成分。

Result: 结果突显了将认知参与转化为行为改变的挑战，特别是在持续的数字习惯和社会强化压力源的环境中。

Conclusion: 基于protégé效应的干预在行为改变方面存在局限性，特别是在反思性数字福祉策略背景下。未来研究可探索互动形式以增强动机和影响。

Abstract: The prot\'eg\'ee effect suggests that individuals learn more effectively when
they teach a subject. While this has shown potential for acquiring knowledge
and skills, can it also support acquiring a new behaviour? This study evaluated
a prot\'eg\'e-based intervention designed to manage digital stress. Over three
weeks, 137 participants with moderate to high digital stress were assigned to
four groups. Two were prot\'eg\'ee-based: a passive group, given material to
teach, and an active group, received headlines and had to search for and
prepare teaching content. Both groups completed three sessions, each focused on
one digital stress component: availability demand stress, approval anxiety, and
fear of missing out. A digital literacy group received similar content and
quizzes, and a control group. Outcomes measured included digital stress,
problematic social media use, word-of-mouth about its management, and issue
involvement. Findings highlight the challenge of translating cognitive
engagement into behavioural change, especially amid persistent digital habits
and socially reinforced stressors. Results offer insights into the limitations
of interventions based on the prot\'eg\'ee effect when applied to behaviour
change, particularly in the context of reflective digital wellbeing strategies.
Future research could explore interactive formats, such as peer engagement or
self-regulatory elements, to enhance motivation and impact.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: TaskAudit是一个通过模拟交互检测移动应用功能可访问性错误的系统，相比现有检查器能发现更多功能错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可访问性检查器大多评估静态或机械生成的上下文，无法捕捉影响移动应用功能的常见可访问性错误

Method: 包含三个组件：任务生成器从应用屏幕构建交互任务，任务执行器使用带屏幕阅读器代理的代理执行任务，可访问性分析器通过检查交互轨迹检测和报告错误

Result: 在真实应用评估中检测到54个应用屏幕中的48个功能错误，而现有检查器只能检测4-20个

Conclusion: TaskAudit能够检测现有工作无法发现的常见错误模式，包括标签功能不匹配、混乱导航和不适当反馈

Abstract: Accessibility checkers are tools in support of accessible app development and
their use is encouraged by accessibility best practices. However, most current
checkers evaluate static or mechanically-generated contexts, failing to capture
common accessibility errors impacting mobile app functionality. We present
TaskAudit, an accessibility evaluation system that focuses on detecting
functiona11ity errors through simulated interactions. TaskAudit comprises three
components: a Task Generator that constructs interactive tasks from app
screens, a Task Executor that uses agents with a screen reader proxy to perform
these tasks, and an Accessibility Analyzer that detects and reports
accessibility errors by examining interaction traces. Evaluation on real-world
apps shows that our strategy detects 48 functiona11ity errors from 54 app
screens, compared to between 4 and 20 with existing checkers. Our analysis
demonstrates common error patterns that TaskAudit can detect in addition to
prior work, including label-functionality mismatch, cluttered navigation, and
inappropriate feedback.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析用户在VR环境中开门任务的手部运动模式，自动检测用户对VR的熟悉程度，使用深度学习分类器在手动追踪和控制器交互中分别达到92.05%和83.42%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR设备普及，越来越多无经验的用户开始使用VR系统。自动检测用户对VR的熟悉程度可以实现实时自适应训练和界面调整，减少用户挫败感并提高任务表现。

Method: 使用基于密码开门任务的手部运动模式分析，采用最先进的深度学习分类器进行自动VR熟悉度检测。在26名参与者（经验用户和无经验用户各半）中进行实验，比较控制器和手动追踪两种交互方式。

Result: 手动追踪交互达到92.05%准确率，控制器交互达到83.42%准确率。跨设备评估中，使用控制器数据训练的分类器在手动追踪数据上测试达到78.89%准确率。混合设备评估整合两种模态达到94.19%准确率。

Conclusion: 手部运动生物特征在实时检测用户VR熟悉度方面具有良好前景，为个性化和自适应VR体验铺平道路。

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) devices become increasingly integrated into everyday
settings, a growing number of users without prior experience will engage with
VR systems. Automatically detecting a user's familiarity with VR as an
interaction medium enables real-time, adaptive training and interface
adjustments, minimizing user frustration and improving task performance. In
this study, we explore the automatic detection of VR familiarity by analyzing
hand movement patterns during a passcode-based door-opening task, which is a
well-known interaction in collaborative virtual environments such as meeting
rooms, offices, and healthcare spaces. While novice users may lack prior VR
experience, they are likely to be familiar with analogous real-world tasks
involving keypad entry. We conducted a pilot study with 26 participants, evenly
split between experienced and inexperienced VR users, who performed tasks using
both controller-based and hand-tracking interactions. Our approach uses
state-of-the-art deep classifiers for automatic VR familiarity detection,
achieving the highest accuracies of 92.05% and 83.42% for hand-tracking and
controller-based interactions, respectively. In the cross-device evaluation,
where classifiers trained on controller data were tested using hand-tracking
data, the model achieved an accuracy of 78.89%. The integration of both
modalities in the mixed-device evaluation obtained an accuracy of 94.19%. Our
results underline the promise of using hand movement biometrics for the
real-time detection of user familiarity in critical VR applications, paving the
way for personalized and adaptive VR experiences.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 基于深度学习使用VR眼动轨迹检测视觉疲劳，EKYT模型在视觉注意力要求高的任务中达到94%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间使用VR会导致视觉疲劳，影响用户体验和安全性。现有疲劳检测方法依赖主观问卷或侵入性生理信号，限制了可扩展性和实时应用

Method: 使用GazeBaseVR数据集，包含407名参与者在5个沉浸式任务中的双眼眼动数据，提取单眼注视角度，评估6种深度分类器

Result: EKYT模型在视频观看和文本阅读等高视觉注意力任务中达到94%准确率，眼动方差和主观疲劳测量显示疲劳与非疲劳状态存在显著行为差异

Conclusion: 眼动动态学可作为VR中连续疲劳检测的可靠非侵入性模态，为自适应人机交互提供实际应用价值

Abstract: Prolonged exposure to virtual reality (VR) systems leads to visual fatigue,
impairs user comfort, performance, and safety, particularly in high-stakes or
long-duration applications. Existing fatigue detection approaches rely on
subjective questionnaires or intrusive physiological signals, such as EEG,
heart rate, or eye-blink count, which limit their scalability and real-time
applicability. This paper introduces a deep learning-based study for detecting
visual fatigue using continuous eye-gaze trajectories recorded in VR. We use
the GazeBaseVR dataset comprising binocular eye-tracking data from 407
participants across five immersive tasks, extract cyclopean eye-gaze angles,
and evaluate six deep classifiers. Our results demonstrate that EKYT achieves
up to 94% accuracy, particularly in tasks demanding high visual attention, such
as video viewing and text reading. We further analyze gaze variance and
subjective fatigue measures, indicating significant behavioral differences
between fatigued and non-fatigued conditions. These findings establish eye-gaze
dynamics as a reliable and nonintrusive modality for continuous fatigue
detection in immersive VR, offering practical implications for adaptive
human-computer interactions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文翻译并验证了AT-GLLM和AT-PLLM量表在阿拉伯语环境中的适用性，证明其是可靠有效的测量工具，支持阿拉伯地区对大型语言模型态度的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在全球的普及，需要适应本地语境和语言的工具来准确测量公众态度。阿拉伯世界LLM采用快速增长，需要文化和语言相关的量表。

Method: 将AT-GLLM和AT-PLLM量表翻译成阿拉伯语，并使用249名阿拉伯语成年人的样本进行验证。

Result: 阿拉伯语版本量表显示出良好的心理测量特性：确认双因子结构、跨性别强测量不变性、良好的内部信度，以及强的收敛和区分效度。

Conclusion: 该量表是可靠有效的工具，支持非西方语境下的研究，有助于绘制LLM感知的全球图景，并促进阿拉伯地区的本地化研究和政策制定。

Abstract: As the use of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly global,
understanding public attitudes toward these systems requires tools that are
adapted to local contexts and languages. In the Arab world, LLM adoption has
grown rapidly with both globally dominant platforms and regional ones like
Fanar and Jais offering Arabic-specific solutions. This highlights the need for
culturally and linguistically relevant scales to accurately measure attitudes
toward LLMs in the region. Tools assessing attitudes toward artificial
intelligence (AI) can provide a base for measuring attitudes specific to LLMs.
The 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, which
measures two dimensions, the AI Fear and the AI Acceptance, has been recently
adopted and adapted to develop new instruments in English using a sample from
the UK: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward
Primary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales. In this paper, we translate the two scales,
AT-GLLM and AT-PLLM, and validate them using a sample of 249 Arabic-speaking
adults. The results show that the scale, translated into Arabic, is a reliable
and valid tool that can be used for the Arab population and language.
Psychometric analyses confirmed a two-factor structure, strong measurement
invariance across genders, and good internal reliability. The scales also
demonstrated strong convergent and discriminant validity. Our scales will
support research in a non-Western context, a much-needed effort to help draw a
global picture of LLM perceptions, and will also facilitate localized research
and policy-making in the Arab region.

TL;DR: Deliberate Lab是一个开源平台，用于进行大规模实时行为实验，支持人类参与者和基于大语言模型的AI代理作为一等参与者，解决了当前实验基础设施的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究人类与AI交互的实验基础设施存在三个主要问题：缺乏支持大规模实时多方研究的平台、部署需要定制化工程限制了可复制性和可访问性、现有工具未将AI代理视为一等参与者。

Method: 开发了Deliberate Lab开源平台，在12个月的公开部署中收集了88名实验者和9195名实验参与者的使用数据，通过案例研究、使用场景分析和深度访谈分析使用模式和工作流程。

Result: 平台成功降低了技术门槛，标准化了对混合人机实验的支持，扩展了研究集体决策和以人为中心AI的方法库。

Conclusion: Deliberate Lab通过提供支持人类和AI代理作为一等参与者的实验平台，显著改善了研究人类与AI交互协作的实验基础设施。

Abstract: Social and behavioral scientists increasingly aim to study how humans
interact, collaborate, and make decisions alongside artificial intelligence.
However, the experimental infrastructure for such work remains underdeveloped:
(1) few platforms support real-time, multi-party studies at scale; (2) most
deployments require bespoke engineering, limiting replicability and
accessibility, and (3) existing tools do not treat AI agents as first-class
participants. We present Deliberate Lab, an open-source platform for
large-scale, real-time behavioral experiments that supports both human
participants and large language model (LLM)-based agents. We report on a
12-month public deployment of the platform (N=88 experimenters, N=9195
experiment participants), analyzing usage patterns and workflows. Case studies
and usage scenarios are aggregated from platform users, complemented by
in-depth interviews with select experimenters. By lowering technical barriers
and standardizing support for hybrid human-AI experimentation, Deliberate Lab
expands the methodological repertoire for studying collective decision-making
and human-centered AI.

### [302] [Unmasking Hiring Bias: Platform Data Analysis and Controlled Experiments on Bias in Online Freelance Marketplaces via RAG-LLM Generated Contents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13091)
*Wugeng Zheng,Guohou Shan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用RAG-LLM生成虚拟自由职业者档案的新方法，通过受控实验分析在线自由职业市场中性别和地域偏见的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线自由职业市场虽然创造了公平环境，但用户档案中的个人信息仍可能导致歧视。现有研究使用现有数据难以控制混杂因素，无法清晰分析性别、地域等因素的影响。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)与大语言模型(LLM)创建逼真的虚拟自由职业者档案，进行受控实验。结合传统统计方法和RAG-LLM生成的数据集，进行模拟招聘实验。

Result: 性别方面：初始招聘决策无显著偏好，但女性自由职业者在项目后阶段更可能获得不完美评分。地域偏见：强烈偏好美国自由职业者，他们在模拟实验中更易被选中，被认为更具领导力，并在实际平台获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 在线自由职业市场仍存在隐性偏见，特别是地域偏见明显。RAG-LLM方法为研究劳动力市场歧视提供了有效的实验工具。

Abstract: Online freelance marketplaces, a rapidly growing part of the global labor
market, are creating a fair environment where professional skills are the main
factor for hiring. While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional
hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing
discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data,
which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of
things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new
method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language
Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled
experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a
clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the
freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with
traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research
utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM,
to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The
results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant
preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are
substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage.
Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based
freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated
experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the
live platform.

TL;DR: 本文综述了虚拟现实中的个性化交互研究，重点关注利用用户沉浸信息和适应机制来修改虚拟环境以增强参与度、性能或特定目标，提出了一个统一的自适应机制五阶段概念框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往孤立地处理用户状态感知或自适应交互设计，限制了我们对它们在VR中组合实施的理解，因此需要系统性地研究个性化交互在VR中的应用。

Method: 通过综合分析采用自适应技术的研究，总结出一个五阶段概念框架，统一不同领域的自适应机制，并识别新兴趋势。

Result: 分析揭示了新兴趋势，包括多模态传感器的整合、对用户状态推断的日益依赖，以及在响应性和透明度之间取得平衡的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出了开发更加以用户为中心的VR系统的未来方向。

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) systems become increasingly more advanced, they are
likewise expected to respond intelligently and adapt to individual user states,
abilities, and preferences. Recent work has explored how VR can be adapted and
tailored to individual users. However, existing reviews tend to address either
user-state sensing or adaptive interaction design in isolation, limiting our
understanding of their combined implementation in VR. Therefore, in this paper,
we examine the growing research on personalized interaction in VR, with a
particular focus on utilizing participants' immersion information and
adaptation mechanisms to modify virtual environments and enhance engagement,
performance, or a specific goal. We synthesize findings from studies that
employ adaptive techniques across diverse application domains and summarize a
five-stage conceptual framework that unifies adaptive mechanisms across
domains. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including the integration of
multimodal sensors, an increasing reliance on user state inference, and the
challenge of balancing responsiveness with transparency. We conclude by
proposing future directions for developing more user-centered VR systems.

TL;DR: 提出触觉优先设计框架，探索数据任务如何与触觉策略和编码选择对齐，为触觉图表设计提供新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉图形通常改编自视觉图表设计，但许多编码在非视觉探索中效果不佳。盲人和低视力人群使用各种物理策略来解读触觉图表，这表明需要超越直接视觉翻译，转向触觉优先设计方法。

Method: 提出推测性触觉设计框架，探索数据任务如何与触觉策略和编码选择对齐，并通过推测性模型展示触觉感知语法如何指导COVID-19仪表板设计。

Result: 开发了触觉感知语法框架，能够指导编码选择，更好地支持触觉格式中的比较、趋势检测和比例估计任务。

Conclusion: 提出了设计启示，并讨论通过协同设计和基于任务的评估进行未来验证。

Abstract: Tactile graphics are often adapted from visual chart designs, yet many of
these encodings do not translate effectively to non-visual exploration. Blind
and low-vision (BLV) people employ a variety of physical strategies such as
measuring lengths with fingers or scanning for texture differences to interpret
tactile charts. These observations suggest an opportunity to move beyond direct
visual translation and toward a tactile-first design approach. We outline a
speculative tactile design framework that explores how data analysis tasks may
align with tactile strategies and encoding choices. While this framework is not
yet validated, it offers a lens for generating tactile-first chart designs and
sets the stage for future empirical exploration. We present speculative mockups
to illustrate how the Tactile Perceptual Grammar might guide the design of an
accessible COVID-19 dashboard. This scenario illustrates how the grammar can
guide encoding choices that better support comparison, trend detection, and
proportion estimation in tactile formats. We conclude with design implications
and a discussion of future validation through co-design and task-based
evaluation.
