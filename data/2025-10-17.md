### [1] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个基于对话的多智能体推理框架，用于零样本食物识别，结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型，通过多轮视觉-文本对话实现协作推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大量标注数据且对未见食物类别泛化能力有限，需要开发无需额外训练或手动标注的零样本食物识别方法。

Method: 集成视觉语言模型和大语言模型，通过对象感知令牌捕捉细粒度视觉属性，交互式推理代理动态解释上下文线索来优化预测，实现多智能体协作推理。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat相比现有无监督和少样本方法实现了更优的识别准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为智能食品质量检测和分析新范式的潜力，能够灵活理解复杂食物场景而无需额外训练。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于分割子宫内膜异位症中常见暗色植入物的系统，能够分析腹腔镜手术视频并标注检测区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症在体内不同位置呈现多种视觉表现，其识别对非专科医生来说非常困难且容易出错，需要为妇科医生提供辅助工具

Method: 训练系统识别暗色子宫内膜植入物，分析腹腔镜手术视频，用多色叠加标注识别区域，并显示检测摘要以改进视频浏览

Result: 系统能够成功识别和分割暗色子宫内膜植入物区域

Conclusion: 该系统为妇科医生治疗子宫内膜异位症提供了有效的辅助工具，有助于提高诊断准确性和视频浏览效率

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [3] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究将传统视觉模型（YOLO）与视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）结合，用于遥感图像分析，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解方面，在标记和未标记数据以及退化图像场景中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感在各领域应用广泛，但传统视觉模型需要大量领域特定标注数据且难以理解复杂环境上下文。视觉语言模型虽能整合视觉和文本数据，但在遥感领域应用不足。

Method: 将YOLO目标检测模型与视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）相结合，在标记和未标记遥感数据以及退化图像场景中进行评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数准确性方面，所有模型的平均MAE提升了48.46%，在原始和退化场景中表现优异。遥感图像综合理解的CLIPScore提升了6.17%。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进高效的遥感图像分析铺平了道路，特别是在少样本学习场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于AI的系统来检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该模型在内部和外部验证中表现出色，甚至超过了9位专家病理学家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是一个重要的预后指标，但存在报告不足和观察者间变异性大的问题，需要提高检测的准确性和一致性。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，在640个前列腺核心针活检样本上进行训练，并在多个队列中进行内部和外部验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC为0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；在外部验证中AUC为0.90，Cohen's kappa为0.55；在专家比较中模型表现最佳（kappa: 0.66）。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到了病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [5] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAPPure框架，扩展对抗净化方法以处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲），通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动效果不佳，而现实中非加性扰动很常见。

Method: 建立对抗图像生成过程，通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架有效扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能够处理多种非加性对抗扰动。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [6] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图的检索-推理增强生成框架，通过结构化图表示视频和中间推理步骤，提升大视频语言模型对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大视频语言模型处理长视频时面临的上下文窗口限制和长期序列信息保留困难的问题，以及传统检索增强生成方法在视频中存在的时序依赖破坏和无关信息干扰等挑战。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：(1) 使用结构化图表示视频，保留视频片段间的语义关系；(2) 引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，促进跨片段相关信息的显式聚合。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型在MLVU上整体性能提升3.0%~5.4%，比最先进的视频RAG方法高出8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构表示和中间推理机制，有效提升了长视频理解的准确性和上下文感知能力，为长视频理解任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

### [7] [Synchronization of Multiple Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051)
*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一种基于原型的时间对齐框架，通过构建共享的紧凑1D表示来同步不同场景或生成AI视频，无需进行耗时的成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步来自不同场景或生成AI的视频具有挑战性，因为存在多样的主题、背景和非线性时间错位。现有方法难以处理这些复杂情况。

Method: TPL从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建共享的紧凑1D表示，通过学习统一的原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段，避免耗时的成对匹配。

Result: 实验表明TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，特别是在细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在复杂视频对齐场景中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在几何不一致、幻觉问题，且基于合成数据训练的方法无法捕捉皮肤皱纹和细发等高频细节，限制了真实感。

Method: 引入两个关键贡献：(1)生成式规范化模块处理多视角图像生成标准化表示；(2)基于transformer的模型在高质量高斯泼溅头像数据集上训练，采用"捕获、规范化、泼溅"流水线。

Result: 该方法从非结构化照片生成具有高度真实感和稳健身份保持的静态四分之一身体头像。

Conclusion: 提出的流水线成功解决了现有方法在几何一致性和高频细节捕捉方面的局限性，实现了超真实且身份保持的3D头像生成。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过将SciPy和scikit-image API与CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM的GPU加速替代方案相结合，解决了生物图像分析中的可扩展性、效率和现代科学计算工作流集成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成越来越大的2D和3D数据集，现有计算方法在可扩展性、效率以及与GPU加速的现代科学计算工作流集成方面存在局限。现有工具缺乏API、不支持GPU加速、3D图像处理能力有限，并且对计算密集型工作流的互操作性差。

Method: cubic采用设备无关的API，当数据位于设备上时将操作分派到GPU执行，否则在CPU上执行，无缝加速广泛的图像处理例程。它基于SciPy和scikit-image API构建，集成了CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM的GPU加速功能。

Result: 通过基准测试单个操作和复制现有的去卷积和分割流程，cubic实现了显著的加速，同时保持了算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与更广泛的Python科学计算生态系统集成，包括其他GPU加速方法，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了视频生成在虚拟制作中的应用潜力，实现了更好的角色一致性、相机控制和光照适应性。

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合建模Big Five和HEXACO人格特质的多模态识别方法，通过优化联合识别来改善人格特质识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注Big Five人格特质识别，但忽视了HEXACO模型中的诚实-谦逊特质，且两种模型在机器学习中的关系尚未明确。

Method: 采用联合优化方法同时识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质，使用自我介绍视频数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验证明所提方法能有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。

Conclusion: 联合建模Big Five和HEXACO能改善多模态人类行为感知，为更全面的人格特质识别提供了有效方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于位平面处理的AI生成图像检测方法，通过噪声特征提取和最大梯度补丁选择，在GenImage基准上达到98.9%的平均准确率，比现有方法快近百倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建误差的AI图像检测方法计算成本高且无法有效捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征，需要更高效准确的检测方案。

Method: 使用位平面引导的噪声图像生成、图像归一化策略、最大梯度补丁选择噪声区域，以及轻量级分类头结构（噪声分类器和噪声引导分类器）。

Result: 在GenImage基准上平均准确率达98.9%，提升11.9%，GAN到Diffusion检测准确率超98.2%，Diffusion到GAN超99.2%，提取速度达毫秒级。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和效率上均显著优于现有方法，具有优秀的跨生成器泛化能力，为AI生成图像检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIA的多模态音频-视觉框架，通过整合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索来检测深度伪造视频，解决了传统检测方法对现代生成模型产生的微小时间差异不敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法主要依赖手动设计的音素-视位对齐阈值、基本帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由先进生成模型（如GANs、扩散模型和神经渲染技术）生成的现代深度伪造内容。这些先进技术生成近乎完美的单帧图像，但会无意中产生被传统检测器忽略的微小时间差异。

Method: 提出PIA（Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis）多模态音频-视觉框架，整合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索。利用音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入，通过识别多个互补模态之间的不一致性来检测细微的深度伪造篡改。

Result: 该集成方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力，代码已在GitHub上公开。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态分析有效解决了传统深度伪造检测方法的局限性，能够检测出先进生成模型产生的微小时间不一致性，为深度伪造检测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Result: 成功实现了28kbps@10米和8.4kbps@50米的室内传输，创下了基于事件OCC系统的比特率新纪录。

Conclusion: EIM调制方案能够充分利用事件视觉传感器的特性，显著提升基于事件OCC系统的传输性能，为高速、低延迟的光通信提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

TL;DR: 提出MACE方法，通过混合专家网络和负载均衡策略，在大规模场景中实现高效定位和高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高、单一网络容量有限的问题。

Method: 使用门控网络隐式分类选择子网络，每次推理仅激活一个子网络，并采用无辅助损失的负载均衡策略。

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低计算成本同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: MACE为大规模场景应用提供了高效的解决方案，在减少成本的同时维持了更高的精度。

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，特别是当人脸在图像中占比较小时，人类对身份变化敏感，这是一个关键但未被充分探索的挑战

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化(IPRO)框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号和引入KL散度正则化来稳定训练

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效增强图像到视频生成中的人脸身份保持能力，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有先进方法如VACE和Phantom在特定主题的多样化场景视频生成方面取得进展，但在动态交互中难以保持多人物身份的一致性，这在多角色身份一致性至关重要的场景中尤为关键。

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，包含人工标注和合成失真数据，专注于视频中人物一致性的成对标注；然后采用针对多人物一致性定制的GRPO变体来优化VACE和Phantom模型。

Result: 实验表明，Identity-GRPO在人物一致性指标上比基线方法提升高达18.9%，并通过消融研究评估了标注质量和设计选择对策略优化的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为将强化学习与个性化视频生成对齐提供了可行的见解，显著提升了多人物身份保持的视频生成质量。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

TL;DR: 提出MatchAttention机制和MatchDecoder，通过动态匹配相对位置和分层解码器实现高效高分辨率跨视图匹配，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像跨视图匹配面临二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的挑战，现有交叉注意力机制难以有效处理。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制动态匹配相对位置，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微滑动窗口注意力采样，设计MatchDecoder分层解码器，引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T仅用3GB GPU内存在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像；在KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 结合高精度和低计算复杂度，实现了实时、高分辨率、高精度的跨视图匹配。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅方法在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 集成2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入指导高斯泼溅的密集化和细化。

Result: 在三个数据集上验证，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯泼溅方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，2D基础模型与3D重建管道的深思熟虑结合可以克服各自方法的局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Motivation: 组织病理学中的域偏移（由采集过程或数据源差异引起）严重影响了深度学习模型的泛化能力。现有方法主要依赖统计相关性建模，但忽视了因果关系。

Method: 设计基于因果推断的框架，实施前门原则，通过设计包含中介变量和观察组织切片的转换策略来利用语义特征并减轻混杂因素影响。

Result: 在CAMELYON17数据集和私有组织病理学数据集上验证，在未见域上获得一致性能提升，相比现有基线方法实现了高达7%的改进。

Conclusion: 因果推断是解决组织病理学图像分析中域偏移问题的有力工具，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Method: 训练免费的三层对比解码加水印方法：1) 在解码层中选择成熟层和业余层；2) 使用水印相关问题识别视觉接地层；3) 应用三层对比解码生成最终输出。

Result: 在POPE、MME和AMBER等公开基准测试中，该方法在减少LVLMs幻觉方面达到了最先进的性能，并生成更多视觉接地的响应。

Conclusion: 提出的三层对比解码加水印方法能有效减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，生成更加视觉接地的响应，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Motivation: 虹膜生物识别系统面临呈现攻击威胁，但缺乏足够的训练和评估数据集，因为构建和成像呈现攻击存在困难。

Method: 使用多领域图像转换扩散StyleGAN，结合扩散模型和GAN的优势，采用多领域架构在不同呈现攻击领域间转换，并使用针对眼部数据的自适应损失函数。

Result: 在LivDet2020数据集上，1%误检率下的真检测率从93.41%提升至98.72%，显著提高了呈现攻击检测系统的性能。

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能有效生成高质量合成眼部图像，为虹膜和眼部生物识别中的数据稀缺问题提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调机制有效解决了MLLM中视觉信息监督不足的问题，为多模态理解提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on

cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet

TL;DR: SPR方法通过空间偏好奖励增强多模态大语言模型的空间理解能力，奖励包含精确定位的详细响应，而非模糊或不准确的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在细粒度空间感知能力上不足，如生成详细区域描述或精确定位对象，且无法满足用户对细粒度空间理解的需求，主要因为现有方法仅关注对预标注指令数据的建模，缺乏对模型实际响应的直接监督。

Method: SPR方法通过随机选择图像区域和MLLMs生成的区域描述，引入语义和定位分数来全面评估文本质量和定位质量，并优化定位精度最高的描述与最低分的初始描述进行直接偏好优化。

Result: 在标准引用和定位基准上的广泛实验表明，SPR能有效提升MLLMs的空间理解能力，且训练开销极小。

Conclusion: SPR通过空间偏好奖励机制成功增强了MLLMs的细粒度空间感知能力，实现了与视觉输入的更好对齐。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象忽略或对象混合问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象这四种场景下。

Method: 提出DOS方法，基于CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，在将文本嵌入输入文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS在四个基准测试中获得了26.24%-43.04%更多的投票，显著优于四种竞争方法。

Conclusion: DOS是改进多对象图像生成的一个实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在保持高分割精度的同时显著提升计算效率，证明了其在脑肿瘤分割中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

TL;DR: BoardVision是一个用于检测主板组装级缺陷的可复现框架，通过集成YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN模型，提出轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡精确率和召回率，并评估了在真实扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主板组装级缺陷检测在电子制造中至关重要，但现有研究主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，组装级检测研究不足。

Method: 使用YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN作为代表性检测器，提出轻量级集成方法Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter)，通过可解释规则平衡精确率和召回率。

Result: 在MiracleFactory主板数据集上进行了系统比较，YOLO在精确率上表现优异但召回率不足，Faster R-CNN则相反。CTV Voter方法有效平衡了性能指标。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了计算机视觉技术如何从基准测试结果过渡到实际的主板制造质量保证应用，并发布了可部署的GUI检测工具。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DCMIL的双课程对比多实例学习模型，用于处理全切片图像进行癌症预后预测，无需密集标注，在12种癌症类型上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学在处理千兆像素级全切片图像时面临计算瓶颈和标注稀缺问题，现有方法往往忽略多放大倍率下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用从易到难的渐进式表示学习，通过双课程对比多实例学习模型直接处理全切片图像，不依赖密集标注。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954名患者，1254万个图块）上的实验表明，DCMIL优于标准WSI预后模型，能识别细粒度预后相关区域并提供稳健的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL能有效处理全切片图像进行癌症预后，识别形态学差异，具有生成新生物学见解的潜力，所有代码已开源。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的神经视频压缩框架，结合了帧内和帧间编码，通过自适应编码策略和双向帧压缩设计，显著提升了压缩效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容、帧间误差传播等方面存在不足，需要借鉴传统视频编码中帧内编码的优势来消除这些限制。

Method: 设计了统一的帧内/帧间编码框架，使用单一模型自适应处理每帧；提出同时两帧压缩设计，利用前向和后向的帧间冗余。

Result: 相比DCVC-RT平均降低10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的比特率和每帧质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该方案通过统一帧内/帧间编码和双向压缩设计，有效解决了现有神经视频压缩的局限性，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

Motivation: 基于深度学习的视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但这些检测器容易受到对抗攻击，特别是通用扰动攻击。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 所提出的攻击在有效性上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe方法，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频目标检测提供了一种高效且隐蔽的通用对抗攻击方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MIR-L方法，通过迭代剪枝策略压缩多任务图像恢复模型，仅保留10%可训练参数的同时维持高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型参数过多导致计算效率低下，需要找到在高度稀疏化情况下仍能保持性能的子网络

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，在多轮中移除低幅值权重，并将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，发现'中奖彩票'子网络

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务上，仅保留10%参数即可达到或超过原始密集模型的性能

Conclusion: MIR-L证明了在高度稀疏化情况下仍能保持多任务图像恢复性能的可行性，为模型压缩提供了有效方案

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 使用Sentinel-2卫星时间序列数据检测牧场放牧活动，通过CNN-LSTM集成模型实现77%的F1分数，能显著提高牧场检查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动对农业生产和生物多样性都有重要影响，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，使用CNN-LSTM集成模型对多边形定义的牧场边界进行二分类预测（放牧/未放牧）。

Result: 在五个验证分割上平均F1分数达77%，放牧牧场召回率达90%。在只能检查4%场地的情况下，模型优先检查非放牧场地可使确认的非放牧场地数量比随机检查增加17.2倍。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费的卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源，用于保护导向的土地利用合规性监测。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba相比Vision Transformers(ViTs)具有线性而非二次方的网络规模扩展特性，计算和内存效率更高，且比传统CNN需要更少的可训练参数。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络，用于三维多孔介质渗透率预测，并与ViT和CNN模型进行性能比较，同时进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Result: 在实际应用中验证了Vision Mamba相比ViTs和CNNs在三维多孔介质渗透率预测中的优势，包括计算效率和内存效率的提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViTs，源代码已公开以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出一种噪声投影器，通过文本条件优化将初始噪声映射到与提示更匹配的分布，解决文本到图像生成中的训练-推理不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法中，不同初始噪声会产生不同的去噪路径，但部分结果与提示对齐不佳。这源于训练时噪声来自提示特定子空间，而推理时来自提示无关的高斯先验分布。

Method: 设计噪声投影器，在去噪前对初始噪声进行文本条件优化。首先采样噪声并通过视觉语言模型获得反馈，然后蒸馏到奖励模型中，最后通过准直接偏好优化训练噪声投影器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提升文本-图像对齐质量，且推理成本低，无需参考图像或手工先验。

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知噪声投影方法有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，提高了文本到图像生成的对齐性能。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

Method: 提出PL-SE-ADA框架，包含两个编码器提取域不变和域特定特征，一个解码器进行图像重建，一个域预测器。通过对抗训练和从分解特征重建图像来确保协调性和信息保留。

Result: 与现有方法相比，PL-SE-ADA在图像重建、疾病分类和域识别方面达到同等或更好的性能，并能可视化域无关和域特定脑部特征。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA提供了一个既有效又可解释的域协调解决方案，特别适用于需要高可解释性的医疗应用场景。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Method: 提出VisualSplit框架，将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，每个作为独立但互补的视觉知识组件。通过重建驱动的预训练方案学习捕获每个视觉描述符的本质，同时保持其可解释性。

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法在视觉理解方面具有有效性，为现代深度学习与经典视觉描述符的结合提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法都是单步调整，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集效果不足，需要多步调整能力来实现更精确的跨模态对齐。

Method: 提出FMA方法：1) 使用固定耦合策略确保类别对应；2) 噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺问题；3) 早停求解器提高效率和精度。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上，FMA相比单步PEFT方法能持续带来显著性能提升，特别是在挑战性数据集上。

Conclusion: FMA通过多步校正能力实现了更精确和鲁棒的跨模态对齐，是首个模型无关的多步调整方法。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种训练无关的提示嵌入编辑方法SDeC，通过抑制场景-身份相关性来解决文本到图像生成中的身份偏移问题，无需预先知道所有目标场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中身份偏移问题，现有方法通常需要预先知道所有目标场景，这在现实中不切实际。研究发现身份偏移的主要来源是场景上下文与身份的自然相关性。

Method: 提出场景去上下文化(SDeC)方法，通过量化SVD方向稳定性来识别和抑制身份提示嵌入中的场景-身份相关性，自适应地重新加权相应特征值。

Result: 实验表明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC是一种高效、训练无关的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，无需预先了解所有目标场景。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

TL;DR: BalanceGS是一个算法-系统协同设计的3D高斯泼溅训练优化方法，通过启发式密度控制、相似性采样合并和内存访问重排序，解决了传统3DGS训练中的密度分配不均、计算负载不平衡和内存访问碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS训练存在三个关键低效问题：高斯密度化过程中的偏斜密度分配、高斯投影中的不平衡计算负载以及颜色泼溅中的碎片化内存访问。

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式工作负载敏感高斯密度控制，自动平衡点分布；2) 系统层面：基于相似性的高斯采样和合并，用自适应工作负载分布替代静态线程-像素映射；3) 映射层面：基于重排序的内存访问映射策略，重构RGB存储并启用共享内存中的批量加载。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上相比3DGS实现了1.44倍的训练加速，质量退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练中的效率瓶颈，显著提升了训练速度同时保持重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Result: 在LlamaPointInPart数据集上表现出优于基线模型的性能，建立了新的评估协议。

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

TL;DR: STANCE是一个图像到视频生成框架，通过Instance Cues和Dense RoPE解决视频生成中的运动一致性问题，无需逐帧轨迹脚本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成在保持物体运动连贯性和交互一致性方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单头优化倾向于纹理而非时间一致性。

Method: 提出两个核心组件：Instance Cues将稀疏的用户可编辑提示转换为密集的2.5D运动场；Dense RoPE在token空间中保留这些提示的显著性，配合RGB+辅助图联合预测。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊性，稳定了优化过程，提高了时间一致性。

Conclusion: STANCE框架有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，通过分离结构和外观处理实现了更好的时间连贯性。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法通过三阶段处理和强化学习训练，有效提升了KB-VQA任务的性能，证明了多模态查询优化和检索结果过滤的重要性。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: Shot2Tactic-Caption框架能够有效生成羽毛球视频的多尺度字幕，既能描述单个击球动作，也能捕捉战术执行过程，包括被中断后恢复的战术执行。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

Result: EVS显著减少令牌数量，同时保持语义保真度，使大型语言模型的首次令牌时间(TTFT)减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。结合随机修剪率的上训练阶段，EVS产生对变化压缩水平具有鲁棒性的模型。

Conclusion: EVS持续改进效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器生成的单个连续潜在token来表示图像，通过微调语义token嵌入和生成解码器，实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时保持SSL空间的良好几何特性，实现高效的生成建模。

Method: 基于预训练的SSL编码器，仅微调语义token嵌入，配合使用流匹配目标的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失来正则化适配的token。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上以极有限的训练预算达到竞争性的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 微调的SSL表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效的生成建模。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA是一种基于Feynman-Kac引导的测试时适应框架，通过扩散模型引导输入适应，无需模型更新或源数据，在ImageNet-C上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的测试时适应方法依赖梯度引导，限制了探索能力和对不同失真类型的泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，维护多个粒子轨迹，通过累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索和置信度，使用伪标签驱动的奖励进行引导。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于基线方法，且无需任何模型更新或源数据。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA通过Feynman-Kac引导机制有效提升了测试时适应的性能，在分布偏移下表现出更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，通过上下文学习从未配对视频片段中学习视频编辑能力，显著提升了指令式视频编辑的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令式图像编辑发展迅速，但扩展到视频领域面临挑战，主要由于构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集成本高昂且复杂。

Method: 基于HunyuanVideoT2V框架，首先在约100万真实视频片段上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万精选编辑对上进行微调，扩展更多编辑任务并提升编辑质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有指令式视频编辑方法，编辑指令跟随能力提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该低成本预训练策略能够有效赋予基础视频生成模型通用编辑能力，并通过少量高质量配对数据进行高效微调，为指令式视频编辑提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播（DBP）集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少输入相关性来加速收敛，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本和碳排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练在低标签场景下性能优秀但计算成本高昂，难以在工业环境中应用，需要更高效的预训练方法

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性应用DBP优化方法，迭代减少各层的输入相关性以加速收敛

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE将训练时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提升1.1个百分点

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中同时减少训练时间、能源消耗并提升下游任务性能，适用于实际工业场景

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的主要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度和地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建EuroMineNet数据集，支持两个任务：(1)多时序采矿足迹制图，使用新的Change-Aware Temporal IoU指标评估；(2)跨时序变化检测。对20个最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试。

Result: GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测对及时缓解至关重要的短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致且可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及将GeoAI应用于社会和环境的更广泛目标。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

TL;DR: 提出了WeCKD方法，通过链式知识蒸馏解决传统知识蒸馏中的知识退化、监督效率低和数据依赖问题，在有限数据场景下实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖强教师模型或大数据集，在真实世界有限数据场景下效果受限，存在知识退化、监督效率低等问题。

Method: 构建弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，形成渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型不仅从前驱学习知识，还会精炼知识并传递给后续模型。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上超越现有监督方法，在其他两个数据集上验证了跨医学成像模态的泛化能力，相比单骨干网络在有限数据下准确率提升高达23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过结构化知识传递显著提升特征学习能力，降低数据依赖性，在有限数据医学图像分析中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Result: 在Qwen2VL-7B和GPT4o基准上，视频时序定位和推理问答任务均取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合性和可解释的推理过程，有效提升了视频理解能力。

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法缺乏学习先验，限制了率失真权衡的进一步提升，需要解决压缩引起的质量退化问题。

Method: 基于初始压缩高斯，构建恢复网络在图像空间建模压缩伪影，引入粗渲染残差作为辅助信息，通过恢复图像监督优化压缩高斯。

Result: 实验验证了框架有效性，在率失真性能上表现优越，渲染质量超过最先进的3DGS压缩方法，同时显著减少存储需求。

Conclusion: 该框架成功利用学习先验提升3DGS压缩性能，实现高质量渲染与低存储的平衡，具有广泛的兼容性。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

best-performing model, Video Swin Transformer, achieves 80.25% accuracy,
showing strong convergence despite limited training data. Our findings
highlight the challenges and potential of adapting existing models to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制大多局限于单层或双层特征优化，忽略了多尺度表示间的丰富层间依赖关系，限制了检测尺度变化较大目标的能力。

Method: CFSAM包含三个关键组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（高效捕捉跨层交互）、以及恢复和增强原始表示的特征融合机制。

Result: 集成到SSD300框架后，在PASCAL VOC上mAP从75.5%提升至78.6%，在COCO上从43.1%提升至52.1%，优于现有注意力模块，且加速训练收敛而不引入显著计算开销。

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对于推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图像标注通常具有混合粒度，受图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求影响，而现有方法假设完整的细粒度标注，不符合实际情况。

Method: 引入ImageNet-F基准，使用CLIP模拟语义模糊性生成混合粒度标签；提出自由粒度学习方法，通过视觉语言模型生成伪属性和半监督学习来增强语义和视觉指导。

Result: 提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提升了分层分类性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准和自由粒度学习方法推进了在现实约束下的分层分类研究。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低光条件下由于像素级信息严重退化，难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题

Method: LightQANet框架包含两个核心模块：光量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因子，光感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示来动态指导特征学习

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种挑战性光照场景下实现了最先进的性能，提供优越的定性和定量结果

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习能够实现跨不同光照条件的一致鲁棒图像质量

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面地形，填补卫星高度图中的缺失值。该方法在重建精度和感知相似度方面优于传统插值和修复技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星探测依赖VR技术，但火星地形数据存在大量缺失值。传统插值方法无法保持几何一致性，而地球上的条件方法无法应用于火星，因此需要开发专门的无条件深度学习方法。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000个NASA HiRISE火星高度图增强数据集上进行训练。采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，然后调整到固定的128x128分辨率。

Result: 在1000个测试样本上，该方法在重建精度（RMSE提升4-15%）和感知相似度（LPIPS提升29-81%）方面均优于逆距离加权、克里金插值和纳维-斯托克斯算法等传统方法。

Conclusion: 基于无条件扩散模型的方法能够有效重建火星表面地形，填补高度图中的缺失值，为空间探索提供更可靠的地形数据。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉运动信号的微型飞行器群通信框架，模仿蜜蜂摇摆舞，使用四种运动基元传递信息，通过事件相机和脉冲神经网络实现低功耗解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电通信在MAV群中面临频谱拥塞、干扰和高功耗问题，需要一种更可靠的替代方案。

Method: 使用四种运动基元作为控制符号，通过事件相机捕捉MAV飞行模式，设计事件帧分割模型和轻量级脉冲神经网络进行动作识别和解码。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，实现了准确解码和低功耗，在受限环境中表现出良好性能。

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV群提供了一种能量高效的通信替代方案，特别适用于受限环境。

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL是一个用于开放词汇目标检测的新框架，通过引入视觉链式思维推理来提升伪标签质量，特别在拥挤或遮挡场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: CoT-PL将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别的伪标签质量分别比现有最佳方法提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO上AP50提升了7.7，在LVIS上新类别的mask AP提升了2.9。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过结构化视觉链式思维推理和对比背景学习，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的性能，达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

TL;DR: 开发了PRISM模型，一种可解释的AI模型，通过整合连续变异谱来表征结直肠癌的形态多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优异，优于现有方法15-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算病理学基础模型往往忽略器官特异性关键形态模式，这些模式代表不同的生物过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了连续变异谱来表征形态多样性，反映了恶性转化是通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原则。模型在424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像上训练。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现优异（AUC=0.70，准确率68.37%，HR=3.34），优于现有CRC特定方法15%和AI基础模型约23%。模型具有性别无关的稳健性和跨临床病理亚组的稳定性能。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种新的可解释AI方法，能够捕捉结直肠癌的形态多样性，在预后预测方面表现卓越，为精准肿瘤学提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告训练AI进行肿瘤分割的新方法，大幅减少了对人工绘制肿瘤掩模的需求，在多种肿瘤类型上实现了优于放射科医生的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期肿瘤检测能挽救生命，但CT扫描中的小肿瘤检测困难。传统AI训练需要大量人工绘制的肿瘤掩模，成本高昂且耗时。而临床实践中几乎每个CT扫描都配有描述肿瘤特征的医学报告，这些丰富信息在AI训练中未被充分利用。

Method: R-Super通过训练AI模型来分割与医学报告中描述相匹配的肿瘤，利用大量现成的医学报告进行AI训练，显著减少了对人工绘制肿瘤掩模的依赖。

Result: 使用101,654份报告训练的AI模型性能与使用723个掩模训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩模训练使灵敏度提高13%，特异性提高8%，在7种肿瘤类型中的5种上超越了放射科医生的检测能力。R-Super还实现了脾脏、胆囊、前列腺、膀胱、子宫和食管等此前无公开掩模或AI模型的肿瘤分割。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战了大规模人工肿瘤掩模创建不可或缺的传统观念，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测建立了一条可扩展且易于实现的路径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新的轨迹表示学习框架，通过统一环境感知和显式路径选择建模来学习更有效的轨迹表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了外部环境和内部路径选择行为对轨迹形成的影响。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块（从POI分布捕获多粒度环境语义）和路径选择编码器（将路段转换建模为决策序列），最终聚合形成全局轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在3个真实数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，在少样本场景下也保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过整合环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能，具有很好的数据效率。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

<details>

Motivation: 解决大容量生成模型无法在智能手机上部署的问题，因为手机内存和计算资源有限。虽然量化方法可以降低模型参数精度实现高效计算，但激进量化会损害模型质量。

Method: 提出分数位量化方法SHORT，渐进式降低模型精度从32位到4位，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持高生成质量。

Result: 在多种扩散模型上验证了SHORT方法的有效性，包括SD3.5-Medium、Sana、Pixart和FLUX.1-schnell，相比标准QAT实现了4-7%更低的FiD，并成功在三星S25U手机上部署运行。

Conclusion: SHORT方法能够在保持生成质量的同时实现高效的模型量化，解决了大模型在移动设备上的部署挑战。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

Motivation: 解决AI肿瘤分割面临的大规模体素级标注数据稀缺问题，这些数据难以创建且需要医学专家参与。

Method: 创建AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描，15,130个肿瘤实例，涵盖胰腺、肝脏、肾脏、结肠、食管和子宫六个器官，由23名放射科专家手动标注。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以显著提升数据扩展效率，AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练AI在六个器官上分割肿瘤提供了强大基础，实现了优于现有公共数据集的性能。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Conclusion: 该框架使医生能够将机器学习诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，提高了对皮肤癌进展的理解，为未来探索开辟了更多可能性。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多模态学习方法，通过预训练专家模型和程序化组合，在无需人工监督的情况下整合多种视觉模态，并开发了高效的小参数模型（<1M）在实时语义分割等任务上达到与大型模型（~300M）相竞争的效果。


<details>

Motivation: 现实世界本质上是多模态的，但传统机器学习模型多为单模态或双模态。为了真正理解世界，需要整合所有独立的模态，特别是在视觉领域。

Method: 使用预训练专家模型和程序化组合，构建完全自主的数据流水线，并采用专门设计的PHG-MAE模型来利用多模态数据，最终将模型高效蒸馏成小参数版本。

Result: 开发的小参数模型（<1M）在性能上可与约300M参数的大型模型竞争，并成功部署在手持设备和网络摄像头上实现实时语义分割，同时框架也支持其他现成模型如DPT进行深度估计。

Conclusion: 通过多模态整合和高效蒸馏，可以在保持竞争力的同时大幅减少模型参数，为在资源受限设备上部署高性能视觉应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same

*Hatef Otroshi Shahreza,Sébastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了多模态大语言模型在面部识别任务上的性能，发现虽然MLLMs能捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中仍落后于专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现优异，但其在面部识别领域的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是开源MLLMs需要在标准基准上与现有面部识别模型进行性能比较。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB和RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs能够捕捉面部相关任务的有用语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中表现不如专用模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的面部识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI Generation方法，通过细粒度意图控制生成多样化的手-物体交互动作，超越了传统固定抓握模式，支持推、戳、旋转等自由交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体交互生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，基于物理先验（如力闭合）或通用意图指令，无法捕捉日常交互的多样性。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集（4.4k个独特交互，92种意图，610个物体类别），提出TOUCH框架——基于多级扩散模型的三阶段方法，利用显式接触建模进行条件控制，并通过接触一致性和物理约束进行细化。

Result: 综合实验表明该方法能够生成可控、多样且物理合理的手部交互动作，能够代表日常活动。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了手-物体交互从抓握到自由形式交互的范围，实现了细粒度语义控制下的多样化交互生成。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

TL;DR: BADAS是一个基于真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据训练的碰撞预测模型家族，专门针对ego-centric评估设计，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分对自车的威胁和不涉及自车的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络进行端到端训练，包括BADAS-Open（基于1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（基于40k专有视频）两个变体，重新标注主要基准数据集以识别自车参与情况。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并产生更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS模型在ego-centric碰撞预测方面表现出色，作者发布了BADAS-Open模型权重、代码以及所有评估数据集的重新标注，以促进该领域研究。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver是一个基于视觉自回归模型的可控文本到图像生成框架，通过参数高效微调实现高保真度和精确控制，改进了MMDiT块并提出了Reference Attention模块来有效整合条件信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散模型已有控制机制，但在视觉自回归范式下实现精确灵活的控制仍未被充分探索，需要弥合这一关键差距。

Method: 提出了ScaleWeaver框架，核心是改进的MMDiT块和Reference Attention模块，该模块丢弃了图像→条件的不必要注意力，降低计算成本并稳定控制注入，同时强调参数重用和零初始化线性投影。

Result: 大量实验表明，ScaleWeaver能够提供高质量生成和精确控制，同时比基于扩散的方法具有更高的效率。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中可控文本到图像生成的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出nlg2choice方法解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类任务中自由形式响应的评估问题，通过两阶段方法：先开放式回答，再约束解码预测最可能选项


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，无法处理细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的情况，且在多选项设置下扩展LLM选择提取到检索问题存在计算成本高的问题

Method: nlg2choice两阶段方法：1) 向MLLM提出开放式问题获得无约束回答；2) 使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能选择。在检索设置中，采用提前停止方法计算约束响应选择概率以显著提高吞吐量

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验显示，该方法在分类和检索评估指标上均有改进，且性能在不同自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中的自由形式响应评估挑战，特别是在多选项检索场景下表现出色

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态大语言模型的视频异常检测框架，通过分析对象活动和交互的文本描述来检测异常，提供可解释性并实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法难以检测涉及对象交互的复杂异常，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻对象对的视觉输入，生成活动和交互的文本描述，将这些描述作为视频中对象活动的高层表示，在测试时与正常训练视频的文本描述进行比较

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法不仅能有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，还在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过文本描述提供内在可解释性，可与多种传统VAD方法结合进一步提升可解释性

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于密集视频对象描述任务复杂且人工标注成本高，现有方法采用分离训练策略导致性能不佳，需要开发端到端的联合训练方法。

Method: 利用最先进的视觉语言模型生成时空定位实体的合成字幕，扩展LVIS和LV-VIS数据集，训练能够联合检测、分割、跟踪和描述对象轨迹的MaskCaptioner模型。

Result: 在LVISCap和LV-VISCap数据集上预训练后，MaskCaptioner在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个基准测试中实现了最先进的密集视频对象描述性能。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕扩展数据集的方法有效解决了密集视频对象描述任务的数据稀缺问题，MaskCaptioner模型展示了端到端联合训练的优越性。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个视频生成框架，通过双时空条件机制和3D场景记忆实现长视频生成，支持精确相机控制和场景一致性保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短视频片段进行条件生成，难以在生成长视频时保持场景一致性和精确相机控制，特别是在跨越时间边界时动态元素会错误保留。

Method: 采用双时空条件机制：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆专门表示从输入视频中提取的静态几何，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景几何和动态元素。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt能够有效保持长距离空间一致性和精确相机控制，同时不牺牲计算效率或运动真实性。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态人体动作生成任务中表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在复杂运动合成方面存在困难，生成的运动往往不够自然、平滑和上下文一致，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出RealDPO对齐范式，使用真实世界视频作为正样本进行偏好学习，采用DPO和定制损失函数对比真实视频与错误模型输出，实现迭代自校正。同时构建RealAction-5K数据集支持复杂运动合成的后训练。

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习有效提升了视频生成中的运动真实感，为复杂运动合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过引入时间对应关系来扩展现有的3D重建方法，能够同时估计动态几何和相机姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于点图的3D重建方法在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确的结果，因为运动物体违反了多视图几何约束。

Method: 除了预测点图外，C4D捕获两种对应关系：短期光流和长期点跟踪。训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息，估计运动掩码分离移动元素和静态背景。引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数。

Result: 实验表明该框架实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: C4D通过时间对应关系成功将3D重建扩展到4D动态场景，解决了运动物体破坏重建的问题。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成令牌注意力的扩散模型，用于降水临近预报，解决了现有方法在可扩展性和长程时空依赖建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报面临大气混沌和紧密耦合的时空动态挑战。现有扩散模型存在可扩展性问题：潜在空间方法需要单独训练自编码器，增加了复杂性；像素空间方法计算密集且缺乏注意力机制，难以建模长程时空依赖。

Method: 在U-Net扩散模型和时空编码器中集成令牌注意力，动态捕捉多尺度空间交互和时间演化，无需单独的潜在模块，避免了像素空间扩散的高资源成本。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验和视觉评估表明，该方法显著优于最先进方法，在复杂降水预报场景中具有更好的局部保真度、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的令牌注意力集成方法有效解决了降水临近预报中的可扩展性和建模能力问题，为复杂大气动态预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估不同基线方法，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大大降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3DVG研究，为现实世界机器人定位问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集、引入对比身份损失来缓解文本到图像生成中的copy-paste问题，在保持身份一致性的同时增强生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份一致性生成模型过度依赖重建训练，导致copy-paste问题——直接复制参考面部而非在姿态、表情、光照等自然变化中保持身份，这限制了生成的可控性和表达能力。

Method: 构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M；提出量化copy-paste伪影和身份保真度-变化权衡的基准；引入对比身份损失的训练范式来平衡保真度与多样性。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少了copy-paste伪影，提高了姿态和表情的可控性，保持了强感知质量。用户研究验证了该方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持富有表现力的可控生成。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缓解了身份一致性生成中的copy-paste问题，在保持身份相似性的同时实现了多样化的可控生成，为多人物场景的身份一致性生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的通用交互动画框架，使用两个条件扩散模型分别处理时空先验，支持图像驱动交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离人-人交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态上下文信息，人类能够基于行为先验从这些姿态中推断上下文并预测过去和未来动态。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用上的实证实验证明了姿态先验的普适性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator能够将高质量动作捕捉数据中的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景中，支持多种交互动画任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，使用内在3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，通过点到高斯变分自编码器和稀疏点流匹配网络实现3D一致的世界建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示，忽略了物理世界固有的3D特性，这会破坏3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，再解码为3D高斯基元；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景上的实验表明，Terra在重建和生成任务中均达到最先进性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现精确的多视角一致性，支持单次生成过程从任意视角灵活渲染，实现可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

TL;DR: 提出无需配对数据的图像编辑训练新范式，通过展开扩散模型并利用视觉语言模型反馈进行端到端优化，在少步设置下达到与监督方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但这类自然配对数据难以大规模获取。现有解决方案使用合成训练对，但会传播和放大预训练模型的伪影。

Method: 直接优化少步扩散模型：训练时展开模型，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供端到端优化的直接梯度；结合分布匹配损失确保生成图像保持在预训练模型学习的图像流形内。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据，该方法在少步设置下与各种使用大量监督配对数据训练的扩散模型性能相当；使用相同VLM作为奖励模型时，也优于基于强化学习的技术如Flow-GRPO。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了无需配对数据的图像编辑训练是可行的，通过直接优化和VLM反馈实现了与监督方法竞争的性能，为图像编辑模型训练提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生视觉语言模型面临的两个关键挑战：明确原生VLMs与模块化VLMs的根本区别及其限制，以及如何使原生VLMs研究更加普及和民主化。

Method: 提出构建原生VLMs的三个指导原则：(i)在共享语义空间中有效对齐像素和词表示；(ii)无缝整合先前分离的视觉和语言模块优势；(iii)内在体现支持统一视觉语言编码、对齐和推理的各种跨模态特性。基于这些原则构建NEO模型家族。

Result: NEO模型能够与顶级模块化模型在各种现实场景中竞争，仅使用3.9亿图像-文本样本就能高效开发视觉感知，同时缓解密集单体模型内部的视觉-语言冲突。

Conclusion: NEO为可扩展且强大的原生VLMs奠定了基石，并配备了一套丰富的可重用组件，促进了成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统发展。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

<details>

Motivation: 现有2D图像编辑模型在多视角图像编辑时无法保持视角间一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程冗长、稀疏视角下不稳定等问题。

Method: 采用耦合扩散采样技术，同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样两个轨迹，通过耦合项强制生成图像的多视角一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了方法的有效性和通用性，适用于各种模型架构。

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视角一致编辑的通用解决方案具有潜力，通过隐式3D正则化实现了高效稳定的多视角编辑。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GRPO和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽略了语义对齐挑战，且从英语到其他语言时执行准确率平均下降6个百分点

Method: 在GRPO框架内结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系

Result: 在MultiSpider数据集上，LLaMA-3-3B模型微调后执行准确率提升至87.4%，语义准确率提升至52.29%；加入对比奖励信号后平均语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%

Conclusion: 使用对比奖励信号进行定向语义对齐可以显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，无需大规模训练数据集，小模型也能超越大模型表现

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究为将AI从孤立数据点生成转向在临床实践中提供集成、可操作且可信赖的AI提供了战略路线图，有望缩小实验室到临床的转化差距。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 当前LLM水印方法在文本质量和检测鲁棒性之间存在权衡，且依赖模型特定信号（如logits）阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型内部信息的公开可验证水印方法。

Method: 利用词性n-gram建模语言不确定性，在语法约束强的上下文中减弱水印信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性高的上下文中增强信号以提高可检测性，检测过程无需模型logits。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立性中文和粘着性韩语等多种语言类型上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度对齐水印强度，实现了公开可验证的检测，在保持文本质量的同时显著提升了水印检测性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，成本高且规模有限。随着LLM的广泛使用，用户在日常交互中产生大量偏好标签，但缺乏质量控制。

Method: 使用两个不同模型生成响应，利用响应不对称性构建用户行为模型，开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户标注的成对偏好数据可以替代专业标注，通过质量评估和过滤机制能够有效支持LLM对齐。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

<details>

Motivation: 现有动态令牌级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由机制，导致不可逆信息丢失和次优令牌选择，限制了大型语言模型在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 引入轻量级特征预测器(LFF)，在路由决策前预测单元输出，实现灵活的"执行或近似"策略，而非简单的"执行或跳过"机制。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上的广泛实验表明，知情路由在多个稀疏度级别上实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡，无需最终LoRA微调即可匹配或超越需要完全微调的基线方法，同时减少50%以上的训练时间。

Conclusion: 知情路由通过前瞻性地评估令牌重要性和可恢复性，有效解决了贪婪路由的信息丢失问题，为高效LLM推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

Method: 提出HIES剪枝标准，将头部重要性分数与注意力熵相结合，为每个头的贡献提供互补证据

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝在模型质量上提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现显著模型压缩而不牺牲准确性或稳定性

Conclusion: HIES方法有效克服了HIS的局限性，通过整合重要性分数和注意力熵，实现了更好的剪枝效果

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流生成的1420个问题，以及首个支持系统评估对话数据分析工具的评价工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分析任务往往目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解意图，但现有基准测试无法捕捉这些复杂性或提供交互支持。

Method: 开发了多智能体工作流从公开数据集文章中生成真实基准测试，创建了1420个对话式数据分析问题，并构建了系统评估工具。

Result: 评估显示新一代LLM能解决更多实例，但在需要持续长时交互的任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了衡量真正协作模型在复杂交互任务上进展的途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型的不确定性量化方法，提出了基于相似性的黑盒框架来评估LLM生成内容的置信度，在问答、摘要和文本转SQL等任务中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不确定性量化是可信AI系统的关键组件，黑盒方法具有适应性强、成本低等优势，但需要研究如何有效评估LLM对其生成内容的置信度。

Method: 提出了基于相似性的非语言化聚合框架，包含多种适用于复杂生成任务的UQ方法，并引入了使用小训练集训练置信度估计模型的新技术。

Result: 在问答、摘要和文本转SQL等多样化任务上的实证研究表明，提出的基于相似性的方法比基线方法能产生更好校准的置信度。

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒不确定性量化方法能够有效评估LLM生成内容的置信度，为可信AI系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种文化感知的仇恨言论检测框架，通过构建个体仇恨子空间来解决训练标签偏见和文化背景差异问题，在各项指标上平均优于现有方法1.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽视了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，且不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的定义存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于现有最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的文化感知框架能有效解决仇恨言论检测中的数据稀疏性、文化纠缠和标签模糊问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

*Dekai Zhang,Simone Conia,Antonio Rago*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分关系形式）的方法，该方法优于现有的基于BERT的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时费力且昂贵，而当前数字时代需要组织大量非结构化文本信息，特别是在电子商务领域需要有效组织产品信息。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体的全自动方法，以部分关系的形式表示。

Result: 通过LLM作为评判者的评估，证明该方法生成的本体优于现有的基于BERT的基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究为更广泛地使用LLM进行产品或其他领域本体提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对事实核查RAG系统的知识投毒攻击方法，能在极低投毒率下翻转事实核查决策并诱导欺骗性解释，无需访问目标模型或检索器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中的知识投毒威胁，传统攻击在可信证据主导的检索环境中效果有限。

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击方法：少样本、语义对齐的投毒技术，通过多注入方式操纵检索内容，无需目标模型访问或token级控制。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，平均攻击成功率86%，投毒率仅为0.93×10^-6，比现有最优方法提升11.2%。

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露了现实世界基于RAG的事实核查系统的严重脆弱性，即使在强反证存在时仍保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

*Zhirong Chou,Quan Qin,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对电子健康记录优化的基础模型，通过结构化序列化方法解决传统模型在捕捉患者纵向依赖关系方面的局限性，在抗生素敏感性预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格和事件特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，这限制了模型捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 通过基于结构化EHR序列的额外预训练扩展SciBERT，设计SerialBEHRT模型来编码临床事件之间的时间和上下文关系，生成更丰富的患者表示。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务中，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的EHR表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明在医疗基础模型预训练中，时间序列化的重要性，SerialBEHRT为学习可泛化的临床数据表示提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec是一种上下文相关的动态短列表机制，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇，提升推测解码性能，解决了固定词汇子集的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法使用固定词汇子集存在两个问题：频率列表依赖语料库且需要重新调优，静态短列表抑制了罕见或领域特定token。这降低了每次验证步骤的期望token数量。

Method: 提出轻量级粗粒度元分类器，将上下文路由到少量token簇；选定top-k簇的并集形成草稿器的短列表，同时验证保留完整词汇和精确性。通过并行执行草稿编码和元短列表计算来优化性能。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，观察到平均接受长度的持续提升，同时上下文相关选择使得更小的短列表不会降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种稳健、加速草稿过程并能泛化到多样化任务的动态短列表机制，解决了固定词汇子集方法的局限性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对组合多任务（如翻译摘要）的新方法，通过在组合的适配器上添加可学习投影层来有效集成任务，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准方法在处理同时执行复杂任务（如从长对话生成翻译摘要）时存在困难，需要解决组合多任务场景的挑战。

Method: 在组合的摘要和翻译适配器之上添加可学习投影层，实现有效集成并减少计算开销，避免大量重新训练或顺序处理。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在云端和移动设备上表现良好且快速，开发了能够无缝执行组合任务的Android应用。

Conclusion: 该框架在需要高速操作和资源约束的现实应用中具有潜在优势，展示了实际可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的推理时方法，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言LLM中的代码切换现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换现象，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 使用潜在空间语言引导方法，通过对平行翻译进行PCA分析识别语言方向，然后沿这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份。

Result: 使用单个主成分实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上，多个语言对的下一token分布差异减少了高达42%。

Conclusion: 语言身份表征集中在最后几层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能以可忽略的计算开销缓解代码切换问题，同时保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文发现成功的LLM推理具有非均匀的信息密度模式，这与人类沟通的均匀信息密度假设相反


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假设的启发，分析LLM推理过程中的信息流，以解决中间步骤不可信或难以解释的问题

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个数学基准测试上进行实验

Result: 在LLM中，成功的推理在全局上是非均匀的：正确解决方案以信息密度的不均匀波动为特征，与人类沟通模式形成鲜明对比

Conclusion: 这一结果挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准，用于测量大型语言模型对不同人物角色的回答一致性。研究发现LLM会根据用户角色提供不一致的事实信息，且一致性与模型提供商和话题相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM是否对不同人口统计特征的用户提供事实不一致的回答，建立独立于模型提供商的公正评估标准。

Method: 对19个LLM进行测试，每个模型针对15个话题请求5个事实，重复100次并添加不同人物角色上下文。通过句子嵌入计算跨角色余弦相似度来衡量一致性。

Result: 在100个角色的实验中，一致性得分范围0.9065-0.7896，平均0.8656。Grok-3最一致，轻量级模型最差。话题间差异明显：就业市场最不一致，G7领导人最一致。

Conclusion: LLM的事实一致性受提供商和话题影响，需要开发角色不变提示策略来确保公平性。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解灾难性干扰的模型编辑方法，能够在长编辑序列中保持原始和修改知识的表示，实现稳定高效的模型更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型编辑方法在顺序编辑场景下存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害先前集成的更新和保留的知识，需要开发更稳定的编辑策略。

Method: 提出EvoEdit方法，通过为每个传入编辑执行顺序零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示，在保留知识上保持输出不变性。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进的定位-编辑技术，速度提升高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在动态演化信息环境中开发更原则性LLM设计方法的必要性，同时提供了一个简单有效且具有强理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: BenchPress是一个人类参与循环的系统，利用RAG和LLM为SQL查询生成自然语言描述，加速领域特定文本到SQL基准的创建，显著减少人工标注时间和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究主要关注公开数据集，但在私有企业数据仓库上效果不佳。手动标注SQL日志以构建基准既耗时又昂贵，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 给定SQL查询，使用检索增强生成(RAG)和LLM生成多个自然语言描述草案，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑以确保准确性和领域对齐。

Result: 在企业SQL日志上的评估显示，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准的时间和努力，结合人类验证提高了标注准确性、基准可靠性和模型评估鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BenchPress为研究人员和从业者提供了评估文本到SQL模型在特定领域工作负载上的机制，通过简化自定义基准创建流程，解决了私有企业环境中的评估挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at

*Chenyu Zhang,Sharifa Alghowinem,Cynthia Breazeal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个集成LLM框架，用于大规模感知辅导对话中的情感动态，分析了16,986个对话轮次，发现学生在AI辅导中通常呈现轻度积极情感和中等兴奋度，但学习过程并不总是顺利，困惑和好奇是常见伴随状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究探讨了LLM在教育环境中的学习影响，但LLM介导的辅导中的情感动态仍未得到充分理解。本研究旨在通过关注学习者不断变化的情感状态，推进将生成式AI负责任地整合到教育中的路径。

Method: 分析了两个学期16,986个对话轮次，使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、兴奋度和学习帮助性的标量评分，以及自由文本情感标签。通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合这些估计。

Result: 学生与AI导师互动时通常报告轻度积极情感和中等兴奋度；困惑和好奇是解决问题的常见伴随状态；挫折感虽然较少出现但仍会阻碍进展；情感状态短暂存在，积极时刻稍长但易受干扰；负面情感通常快速解决，有时直接反弹为积极状态；中性时刻常作为转折点。

Conclusion: 中性时刻更倾向于引导学生向上而非向下，这为导师在这些关键时刻进行干预提供了机会，强调了在AI辅导中关注情感动态的重要性。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

TL;DR: 美国国家气象局开发基于AI的自动翻译系统，为6800万非英语母语者提供多语言天气预报服务，目前支持西班牙语、简体中文、越南语等语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为美国6800万非英语母语者提供准确、及时、文化相关的天气预警和预报信息，推进'天气就绪国家'建设。

Method: 与LILT合作，利用其专利训练过程使大型语言模型适应天气术语和信息的神经机器翻译，结合GIS地图分析语言需求分布。

Result: 开发出可扩展的自动翻译系统，显著减少手动翻译时间，减轻操作负担，并建立了包含警告、7天预报和教育活动的实验性多语言网站。

Conclusion: 该系统使美国向覆盖所有公民的国家预警系统迈进了一步，并在设计中融入了道德AI实践以确保透明度、公平性和人工监督。

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2T框架将语言规则融入神经网络训练目标，通过自适应损失函数处理OOV词汇，在无标注文本上训练就能达到98.2%的POS标注准确率，优于基于300标注句子的AfriBERTa。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出原则学习(PrL)范式，让模型通过显式任务约束而非仅依赖标注数据进行训练，特别适用于低资源语言场景。

Method: R2T框架结合多层级语言规则和神经网络，使用包含正则化项的自适应损失函数来学习处理OOV词汇的不确定性。

Result: 在Zarma语POS标注任务中，仅用无标注文本训练的R2T-BiLSTM模型达到98.2%准确率；在NER任务中，R2T预训练模型仅用50标注句子就优于用300标注句子训练的基线。

Conclusion: R2T框架展示了原则学习的有效性，能够显著减少对标注数据的依赖，在低资源语言处理中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

TL;DR: CoRE是一种利用模型一致性来增强大语言模型集成鲁棒性的即插即用技术，通过token级和模型级一致性处理来应对集成中的错误信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同大语言模型具有互补能力，但集成方法对错误信号的鲁棒性关注不足，这些错误信号通常源于异构分词方案和模型能力差异。

Method: 提出CoRE技术：token级一致性使用低通滤波器降低高不一致性token的权重；模型级一致性通过提升高自信度和低分歧的模型输出来增强全局一致性。

Result: 在多种基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的实验表明，CoRE能持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE通过token级和模型级的一致性处理，有效提升了LLM集成的鲁棒性，可无缝集成到各种集成方法中。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Motivation: 解决医疗视觉问答中生成自由文本回答和结构化伤口属性的挑战，支持临床决策和患者护理。

Method: 采用检索增强生成框架，将通用指令调优的大语言模型与领域内文本和视觉示例相结合，无需额外训练或复杂重排序。

Result: 在19个团队51个提交中排名第三，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和基于LLM的指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG与通用LLMs结合为多模态临床NLP任务提供了简单有效的基线方法。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer模型存在显著内存和计算开销，研究发现了架构冗余，为优化提供了机会

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝研究，通过归一化和注意力计算的线性特性，用MLP近似整个transformer块

Result: 在中等上下文场景下，ShishuLM相比父模型内存需求降低25%，训练和推理延迟提升40%

Conclusion: 研究为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了见解

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型的推理策略目前仅限于自回归范式的基于前缀的提示方法，需要更专门的调节方法。

Method: Template Infilling (TI)方法首先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充掩码片段；Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA)根据生成置信度自适应调整片段长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线实现了17.01%的持续改进，并在多令牌生成设置中保持生成质量的同时实现有效加速。

Conclusion: TI方法为扩散语言模型提供了有效的结构控制，显著提升了性能并支持高效的生成加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures
composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different
expressions), and 2043 unique composite expressions (from 11144 different
expressions). This dataset provides a reference standard for named entity

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，可在仅解码器语言模型中实现token级别的层跳过，通过sigmoid线性门对分支输出进行压缩，在推理时根据门值对低重要性token进行跳过，节省计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的早期退出或基于路由器的混合深度模型存在不稳定且需要大量重新训练的问题，需要一种能够在预训练模型上稳定微调的层跳过方法。

Method: 为每个Attention/MLP分支配备sigmoid线性门，压缩分支输出后重新进入残差流；在推理时根据门值对token进行排序，使用每层预算跳过低重要性token。

Result: 在长形式推理任务中节省高达15%的计算成本，同时保持超过90%的基线准确率；在指令调优模型上，全计算时获得准确率提升，在约50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定可微的门控机制，能够有效节省计算成本，同时为transformer信息流提供洞察，并能与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs仅使用自然语言在不确定性下进行顺序决策的能力，目前这一领域尚未充分研究。

Method: 创建多臂老虎机环境，LLMs仅通过文本反馈（"你获得了一个代币"）与环境交互，没有数值线索或显式概率，需要从语言线索推断潜在奖励结构并相应调整。

Result: 大多数LLMs表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B达到89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLMs和传统方法（汤普森采样、ε-贪婪、UCB等）。

Conclusion: 概率推理能够仅从语言中涌现，该基准是评估自然主义、非数值语境中决策能力的重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

TL;DR: 提出Catch Your Breath (CYB)训练方法，让语言模型能动态调整每个输入token的计算步数，通过输出<don't know>请求额外计算时间，使用<pause>token获得更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让语言模型能够根据输入token的复杂性自主调整计算资源分配，在需要更多思考时请求额外计算时间，提高计算效率和准确性。

Method: 提出三种CYB损失函数：CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）、CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚），通过微调实验确定最佳变体。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能根据token复杂性自适应调整处理时间。

Conclusion: CYB方法使语言模型能智能地分配计算资源，在复杂token处请求更多计算时间，提高整体效率和准确性。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Result: 在需求工程领域的概念验证中，使用分类器辅助模块成功提高了软件需求生成的质量

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一个简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，无需复杂的辅助生成模型

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM社会模拟研究大多局限于多项选择或简答格式，忽视了LLM的生成性本质，无法充分模拟真实社会意见的多样性和复杂性。

Method: 基于调查方法学研究和NLP最新进展，提出在LLM社会模拟中采用自由文本生成方法，捕捉主题、观点和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法可以改善测量和设计，探索意外观点，减少研究者偏见，捕捉表达性和个体性，辅助预测试，提升方法效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLM的开放式生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

Motivation: 评估当前最先进LLMs在非结构化文本分类任务中的实际性能，了解其局限性和改进方向。

Method: 使用8,660个人工标注样本和相同的零样本提示，对10个LLMs进行统一评估，采用经典指标和LLM特定指标。开发并测试了基于集成的多模型协作方法。

Conclusion: 模型规模和架构改进本身不能确保更好的分类准确性。协调多个模型的集成方法比单纯扩大规模更有效，可能是达到或超越人类专家性能的最佳路径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

TL;DR: 提出了ProofBench数据集和ProofGrader评估器，用于细粒度评估LLM生成的数学证明，在7分制评分中MAE达到0.926，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理方面主要关注可验证的最终答案，但生成和验证自然语言数学证明仍是一个开放挑战，缺乏可靠的细粒度评估器是关键瓶颈。

Method: 引入ProofBench专家标注数据集，包含145个数学竞赛问题和435个LLM生成的证明。系统探索评估器设计空间，开发ProofGrader评估器，结合强推理骨干模型、参考解和评分方案的丰富上下文，以及简单集成方法。

Result: ProofGrader在专家评分上达到0.926的MAE，显著优于朴素基线。在最佳n选择任务中，当n=16时平均得分4.14，填补了朴素二元评估器(2.48)与人类oracle(4.62)之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader在细粒度数学证明评估方面表现出色，具有推进下游证明生成的潜力，为解决LLM数学证明验证挑战提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and
adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative
frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Motivation: 现有方法在高质量监督微调数据选择过程中过度依赖LLMs内部知识、可解释性弱且泛化能力有限，需要解决这些局限性。

Method: 提出THTB框架，结合质量过滤与内在和外在难度评分，优先选择高层次认知指令，为高效SFT提供可解释和可量化的标准。

Result: 仅用5%数据训练的模型就能超越全数据集训练效果，在垂直领域仅用2%数据就能超越更大数据集训练的模型，展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: THTB在数据选择和标注指导方面都表现出色，为领域适应提供了强大潜力，代码、数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注单轮攻击、缺乏跨语言覆盖，且依赖的分类法要么未能捕捉攻击策略的多样性，要么强调风险类别而非越狱技术本身。

Method: 进行结构化红队挑战，开发包含7个家族（模仿、说服、权限提升、认知超载、混淆、目标冲突、数据投毒）的50种越狱策略分层分类法，分析攻击数据，评估基于分类法的提示检测效果，创建多轮对抗对话数据集。

Result: 建立了全面的越狱策略分类法，分析了不同攻击策略的成功率和模型漏洞利用方式，发现基于分类法的提示能改进自动检测，创建了标注的多轮对抗对话数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对越狱技术有效性的理解，提供了系统化的分类框架和数据集，有助于改进大语言模型的安全防御机制。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，准确识别文本作者变得越来越困难，需要开发有效的归属方法。

Method: 使用固定风格嵌入和GPT-4o LLM法官两种方法，在人类AI平行语料库上测试，该语料库包含6个领域的600个平衡实例，每个实例有人类提示和AI生成的续写。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT续写上表现更好（82% vs 68%），LLM法官在LLaMA续写上略优（85% vs 81%）。LLM法官在小说和学术文本中显著优于风格嵌入，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要混合策略。两种方法在不同文本类型中各有优势，表明需要根据文本特征选择合适的归属方法。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Motivation: 研究窄域微调如何影响LLM激活模式，探索模型差异分析在理解微调领域中的应用价值，为AI安全和可解释性研究提供更真实的案例。

Method: 使用模型差异分析技术，比较微调前后模型的激活差异，在随机文本前几个token上分析激活模式，并创建基于LLM的可解释性代理来理解微调领域。

Result: 发现窄域微调产生的偏见包含微调领域的关键信息，使用这些偏见的代理性能显著优于基线方法。混合预训练数据可减少偏见，但残留风险仍存在。

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在激活中保留训练目标的明显痕迹，这为改进训练方法提供了方向，同时警告使用此类模型作为研究代理可能不现实，需要更深入研究窄域微调的影响。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

TL;DR: RAID框架通过优化连续嵌入空间中的对抗性后缀，结合拒绝感知正则化和连贯性约束，有效绕过LLM安全机制，实现更高的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能优异，但仍容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，需要系统性地探测这些安全漏洞。

Method: 将离散token松弛为连续嵌入，使用联合目标函数优化：(i)鼓励受限响应，(ii)拒绝感知正则化引导激活远离拒绝方向，(iii)连贯性约束保持语义合理性。优化后通过批评引导的解码过程将嵌入映射回token。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID相比现有白盒和黑盒基线方法，以更少的查询和更低的计算成本实现了更高的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 随着LLM在日常生活中的广泛应用，特别是在医疗、人际关系和法律等关键领域作为建议提供者，需要了解LLM在政治和道德领域的响应是否存在偏见。

Method: 应用道德基础理论框架，直接比较LLM响应与现有人类研究数据，通过三种方式评估：LLM固有响应、直接政治意识形态表示、以及基于构建人物角色的响应。

Result: 系统分析了LLM在这些条件下的行为，揭示了AI生成响应中政治和人口统计依赖性的程度。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLM在政治和道德领域的偏见提供了重要见解，有助于评估AI系统在这些敏感领域的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于示例的上下文学习缺乏在抽象层面的知识检索和迁移模块，受认知科学中模式理论的启发，人类通过激活预先存在的心理框架来理解新信息。

Method: 从先前的示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的关键推理步骤模板(schema)，用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，当单个演示示例质量高时，SA-ICL在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上持续提升性能，最高达36.19%，同时减少了对演示数量的依赖并增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的各种ICL策略，还为增强LLMs中类人推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法需要真实标注数据，但高质量标注成本高且耗时，需要开发无需标注的优化方法。

Method: PDO将问题建模为双人赌博机设置，使用Double Thompson Sampling选择信息丰富的提示比较，结合Top-Performer Guided Mutation扩展候选提示池。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO持续优于基线方法，消融研究验证了D-TS和提示突变的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种无需标注数据的有效提示优化框架，能够利用LLM判断的成对偏好反馈来改进提示性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Conclusion: LLMs确实在内部表示中编码运算符优先级，部分嵌入交换技术可以有效地修改运算符优先级。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，有效解决了知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，提升了归纳知识图谱推理的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are

Conclusion: 增强中间能力对提升RAG系统性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为评估和改进这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在辩论中倾向于迎合法官观点而非坚持自身信念，顺序辩论存在显著偏见，模型在捍卫自身信念时更具说服力但反信念论点质量更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辩论实验依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了说谎的主观维度——说谎需要相信所辩护的立场是错误的。本研究将辩论应用于主观问题，明确测量语言模型的先验信念。

Method: 让辩论者选择偏好立场，然后面对与自身先验信念冲突的法官角色，测试模型是否会采用迎合策略。比较了顺序和同时两种辩论协议，评估模型在捍卫与自身信念一致vs不一致立场时的说服力和论点质量。

Result: 模型倾向于选择与法官角色一致的立场而非自身信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩论者存在显著偏见；模型在捍卫与自身信念一致立场时更具说服力；但反信念的论点在成对比较中被评为质量更高。

Conclusion: 这些结果有助于人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Motivation: 现有的网络深度研究代理在长时程推理方面存在挑战，传统指令调优数据集缺乏对难度和质量的精细控制，且现有研究常常混淆数据和训练效果。

Method: 采用两阶段数据合成管道，利用基线网络代理在多个角色中工作：尝试回答问题、验证事实性、检查替代答案和执行过滤，通过逐步增加任务复杂度生成数据。

Result: 实验表明，尽管数据集较小，但训练出的网络代理在多个基准测试中表现优于现有数据集，工具使用动作多样性是现有方法的两倍。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成高质量训练数据，提升网络代理在复杂问答任务中的性能，同时避免重复工具调用行为。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳当前认为可读性（如儿童导向语料）对小语言模型能力发展至关重要的观点，质疑将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的做法

Method: 构建结构匹配但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较小语言模型在不同可读性语料上的训练表现，并分析统计简单性指标

Result: 模型在复杂成人文本和简化语言上的表现相当，甚至在复杂文本上发展连贯性的速度更快；统计简单性（n-gram多样性）是学习能力的更强预测因子

Conclusion: 可读性本身并不能预测小语言模型的连贯性或学习效率，应避免无实证基础地将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Motivation: 化学元素属性数据难以直接测量，传统数值分析方法无法有效建模复杂关系，现有AI方法存在幻觉和缺乏可解释性问题，需要更好的元素表示方法支持材料科学研究。

Method: 使用语言模型从维基百科文本生成全局通用嵌入和局部属性特征向量，设计基于自注意力的测试时训练方法，通过Vanilla回归减少预测误差。

Result: 成功开发了Element2Vec框架，能够有效表示化学元素，解决了科学文本分布差异和数据稀疏的挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作为材料科学中AI驱动发现奠定了基础，展示了语言模型在元素属性预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Motivation: 现有PRM在测试时扩展中表现不稳定，有时甚至不如简单的多数投票，需要找到更有效地利用PRM验证信号的方法。

Method: 建立理论框架分析LLM和PRM信号的最优组合策略，提出权重函数预校准方法，通过加权聚合响应来优化选择过程。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的实验表明，校准方法显著提升TTS效率，性能超越传统加权多数投票，计算量仅需21.3%。

Conclusion: 智能聚合策略比单纯增加测试时计算量更能有效提升性能，为PRM在TTS中的应用提供了更优路径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

TL;DR: FACTS是一种快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要方法，通过离线模板生成实现查询聚焦的表格摘要，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格摘要方法存在多个问题：表格到文本模型需要昂贵的微调且难以处理复杂推理；基于提示的LLM方法面临token限制和效率问题，同时会暴露敏感数据；现有的代理流程依赖分解、规划或手动模板，缺乏鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: FACTS通过离线模板生成方法，创建包含SQL查询和Jinja2模板的离线模板，这些模板可以在共享相同模式的多个表格中重复使用，通过渲染生成自然语言摘要。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，FACTS始终优于基线方法，证明了其作为实际查询聚焦表格摘要解决方案的有效性。

Conclusion: FACTS通过可重用的离线模板实现了快速摘要，通过可执行的SQL查询确保了准确性，并通过仅向LLM发送表格模式来保证隐私合规性，是现实世界查询聚焦表格摘要的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Motivation: IoT网络产生多样化高流量数据，需要跨层行为、协议和上下文解释，而非孤立检测，以获取有意义的洞察。

Method: 集成特征提取、基于Transformer的异常检测、流量摘要、威胁情报增强和检索增强问答的AI代理框架，使用混合检索（词法和语义搜索+重排序）。

Result: 在多个IoT流量捕获和六个开放模型上的实验表明，混合检索显著提升BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR和BERTScore指标；系统分析显示低CPU、GPU和内存开销。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了IoT网络流量的全面高效解释，混合检索策略优于纯密集检索，系统资源消耗低。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学查询需要深入理解专业知识并整合多源信息，但现有大语言模型生成的生物医学内容缺乏科学严谨性，经常虚构蛋白质功能和结构信息。

Method: 通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤，BioMedSearch生成高质量问答结果。构建了包含3000个问题的BioMedMCQs数据集进行评估。

Result: BioMedSearch在所有推理级别上都显著提高了准确率：Level 1从59.1%提升到91.9%；Level 2从47.0%提升到81.0%；Level 3从36.3%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch框架能够有效提升复杂生物医学问答任务的准确性，特别是在需要深度推理的挑战性问题上表现优异。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and
BioMedMCQs are available at: https://github.com/CyL-ucas/BioMed_Search

TL;DR: LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis：持续接触垃圾网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力持续下降。通过控制实验发现，在垃圾数据上持续预训练会显著损害模型的推理、长上下文理解、安全性等能力，并增加"黑暗特质"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据质量对LLM能力的因果影响，验证垃圾网络文本是否会导致模型认知能力下降，为持续预训练的数据筛选提供安全指导。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾和控制数据集，通过两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量），在匹配token规模和训练操作条件下对4个LLM进行持续预训练对比实验。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致推理能力显著下降（Hedges' g>0.3），ARC-Challenge从74.9降至57.2，RULER-CWE从84.4降至52.3。发现思维跳跃是主要病变，指令调优和干净数据预训练只能部分恢复能力。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力衰退的因果驱动因素，应将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并建议对部署的LLM进行常规"认知健康检查"。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在关键风险，临床部署前迫切需要公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

Motivation: 小语言模型在本地硬件上运行具有隐私、成本和环保优势，但在多步推理和领域知识任务上表现不佳，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 构建指令语料库，将相似训练问题分组并通过GPT-5创建指令。推理时检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤，提供结构化推理指导。

Result: 在MedQA、MMLU专业法律和MathQA任务上，指令检索带来一致性能提升：MedQA提升9.4%，MMLU法律提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%。

Conclusion: 指令检索能有效增强小语言模型的推理能力，简洁指令效果更好，改进幅度取决于模型家族和内在推理能力。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework

rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能够生成高质量文学文本并模仿作者风格，以及这对版权纠纷的影响。

Method: 采用预注册研究，比较MFA专家作家与三个前沿AI模型（ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini）在模仿50位获奖作家风格方面的表现，通过159名专家和普通读者的盲评进行对比。

Result: 上下文提示生成的AI文本在专家评价中表现较差，但经过微调的AI文本在风格忠实度和写作质量上都优于专家人类写作，且很少被AI检测器识别。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使AI能够生成读者偏好的非逐字写作，这对版权法中"对潜在市场或价值的影响"这一合理使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

### [161] [Less is More: Improving LLM Reasoning with Minimal Test-Time Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13940)
*Zhen Yang,Mingyang Zhang,Feng Chen,Ganggui Ding,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MTI框架，通过仅在不确定位置应用选择性CFG干预和轻量级负提示引导，以最小开销提升推理准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在测试时通过增加推理计算来提升推理能力，但效率低下。研究发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有少数高熵标记显著影响输出正确性。

Method: MTI包含：(1)选择性CFG干预，仅在不确定位置应用分类器自由引导；(2)轻量级负提示引导，重用主模型的KV缓存来高效近似无条件解码。

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升，Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MTI是一种无需训练的方法，通过局部化干预有效提升推理性能，在准确性和效率之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统中错误类型的新分类法，包含错误示例和实用建议，并创建了一个带错误类型标注的数据集，同时提出了与分类法一致的自动评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界RAG系统的复杂性，存在许多导致错误输出的潜在原因。理解实践中可能发生的错误范围对于稳健部署至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个新的RAG系统错误类型分类法，整理了带错误类型标注的错误RAG响应数据集，并提出了与分类法一致的自动评估方法。

Result: 开发了一个包含错误类型分类、示例数据集和自动评估方法的完整框架，代码和数据已公开。

Conclusion: 该工作为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了实用的分类框架和评估工具，有助于在开发过程中跟踪和解决错误。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at
https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/rag-error-classification.

TL;DR: 德国Commons是迄今为止最大的公开许可德语文本集合，包含1545.6亿token的高质量文本，来自41个来源的7个领域，为开发真正开放的德语语言模型提供法律合规的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型开发依赖大规模训练语料，但大多数语料许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。对于非英语语言，公开许可文本尤其稀缺，德语领域存在关键空白。

Method: 从41个来源系统收集7个领域的数据，实施全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式化修复处理流程，确保异构文本源的质量一致性。所有子集至少采用CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可。

Result: 构建了154.56亿token的高质量德语文本集合，涵盖法律、科学、文化、政治、新闻、经济和网络文本等7个领域，为德语语言模型训练提供法律合规的开放数据。

Conclusion: 德国Commons解决了公开许可德语预训练数据的关键缺口，使开发真正开放的德语语言模型成为可能，同时发布了语料构建和数据过滤代码，确保完全可复现和可扩展。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

*Shehenaz Hossain,Haithem Afli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRaFT是一个基于解释的多语言评估框架，通过四个可解释指标评估大语言模型在跨文化背景下的推理能力，发现文化意识不是模型固有属性，而是通过语言框架显现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅基于答案准确性，无法反映模型对文化背景的真正理解，需要开发能够评估跨文化推理能力的框架。

Method: 使用CRaFT框架，基于世界价值观调查的50个文化相关问题，翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，评估三个模型（GPT、DeepSeek、FANAR）的2100多个答案-解释对。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅性，孟加拉语增强流畅性，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT跨语言适应更好但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: 文化意识在LLMs中不是固有属性，而是通过语言框架显现。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在抽象推理任务中的语言偏见，因为现有研究多关注依赖策略或知识的推理任务，而抽象推理在日常生活中更为重要。

Method: 构建基于纽约时报Connections游戏的基准，包含英语、西班牙语、中文、印地语和阿拉伯语五种语言背景，并提出游戏难度测量方法以控制比较。

Result: 实验发现英语模态在此抽象推理任务中表现更好，开源与闭源模型之间存在性能差异。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在抽象推理任务中存在语言偏见，英语模态通常表现更优，且模型类型（开源vs闭源）影响性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Motivation: 探索语言中音义系统关系在大规模定量研究中的表现程度，包括已识别和未识别的现象。

Method: 采用分布方法分析6种语言（英语、西班牙语、印地语、芬兰语、土耳其语和泰米尔语）中语素的语音和语义相似性空间的对齐情况，使用统计测量套件。

Result: 发现了一系列文献中未识别但可解释的音义对应关系，以及跨语言模式；对5个先前假设的音义对应关系得到部分支持。

Conclusion: 音义象似性在大规模跨语言研究中确实存在，既有新的发现，也有对现有假设的验证。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

TL;DR: ERGO方法通过监测LLM内部不确定性（香农熵）来动态调整多轮对话上下文，当检测到熵值急剧上升时触发提示整合，显著提升增量信息对话的性能和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多轮对话中，当信息逐步呈现时会出现显著性能下降，这影响了LLM在现实世界中的可用性。作者假设模型不确定性的突然增加标志着对话对齐问题。

Method: 引入ERGO方法，通过持续量化下一个token分布的香农熵来监测内部不确定性，当检测到熵值急剧上升时触发自适应提示整合，将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰。

Result: 在增量揭示指令的多轮任务中，ERGO相比标准基线平均性能提升56.6%，峰值性能能力提升24.7%，性能不可靠性降低35.3%。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性的干预可以同时提高对话AI的准确性和可靠性，将不确定性视为语言和建模中可变性的体现并作出响应是有效的策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DROID是一个紧凑的端到端框架，通过结合通用语义编码和领域特定编码的双重表示，使用单一校准阈值实现OOS意图检测，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测超出范围(OOS)的用户话语是任务导向对话系统和开放集意图识别的关键挑战，现有方法依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块。

Method: 结合通用句子编码器(USE)和领域适应的Transformer去噪自编码器(TSDAE)的双重编码器，融合表示后通过轻量级分支分类器处理，使用单一校准阈值分离领域内和OOS意图，无需后处理评分。

Result: 仅使用150万可训练参数，在多个意图基准测试中持续优于最新基线，已知意图的macro-F1提升6-15%，OOS意图提升8-20%，在低资源设置中收益最显著。

Conclusion: 双重编码器表示与简单校准可以产生稳健、可扩展且可靠的OOS检测，适用于神经对话系统。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，通过强化学习框架利用SFT数据集提升基础模型的指令跟随能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于传统SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，希望将强化学习框架应用于广泛的SFT数据集，以改进基础模型的指令跟随能力，避免仅依赖下一个token预测目标。

Method: RLSR方法让基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，然后在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应之间的余弦相似度作为奖励分数。

Result: RLSR直接替代SFT时，在AlpacaEval上获得26.34%胜率，优于SFT的21.01%；SFT+RLSR组合进一步提升至30.73%胜率。

Conclusion: RLSR能有效替代或增强SFT，在指令跟随基准测试中取得显著性能提升，展示了强化学习框架在利用SFT数据集方面的优势。

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置文件而受损，这些配置文件未经与目标个体的对齐验证，包含经过筛选的信息和人格特征。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或基于理论的、结构化分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的认知差异，并精炼角色配置文件以减轻这些差异。

Result: 在四个不同行为预测场景（正式辩论、社交媒体帖子、公开访谈、电影评论）上使用五种LLM进行评估，DPRF相比基线角色配置文件能持续显著改善行为对齐，并在模型和场景间具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置文件和增强下游应用（如用户模拟、社会研究、个性化AI）的有效性提供了稳健的方法论。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段式离线搜索和在线置信度早期退出来平衡效率和准确性，实现最高1.70倍加速且准确率损失小于4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然提升了小语言模型的推理能力，但增加了延迟。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）由于阶段间跳过敏感度差异和冗余输出令牌生成两个关键挑战，难以在此场景下平衡效率和准确性。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段式离线搜索分配最优层预算，以及基于置信度的在线生成早期退出机制来抑制不必要的解码。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试中，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍的加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的效率和准确性平衡问题，通过智能的层跳过策略显著提升了推理速度，同时保持了较高的准确率。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

*Parsa Hejabi,Elnaz Rahmati,Alireza S. Ziabari,Morteza Dehghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过多数投票生成伪标签和表示对齐损失，提升LLM对提示扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对相同提示的不同表述时经常产生不一致的回答，需要提高其鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵（CCE）使用多数投票创建硬伪标签；表示对齐损失将低置信度和非多数预测器拉向共识。

Result: 在11个数据集上评估，平均提高观察一致性11.62%，F1分数提升8.94%，跨格式性能方差降低3.29%。在域外评估中也表现良好。

Conclusion: F²C是增强LLM在提示扰动下一致性、性能和泛化能力的有效无监督方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

*Jihao Zhao,Zhiyuan Ji,Simin Niu,Hanyu Wang,Feiyu Xiong,Zhiyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MoM框架，将RAG从被动分块转为主动理解，通过模拟人类认知过程提取文档记忆，提升小语言模型的文本处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法仅理解相关文本块，限制了知识内化和推理能力，需要模拟人类阅读的认知过程来改进。

Method: 使用LLM模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲，指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；采用多路径采样和多视角评估机制选择最优文档记忆；结合反向推理策略训练SLM。

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验表明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块问题，为LLM提供语义完整的文档记忆，使SLM实现类人智能文本处理。

Conclusion: MoM框架通过主动文档记忆提取和人类认知模拟，显著提升了RAG系统的知识内化和推理能力，为小语言模型实现类人智能文本处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种实验方法来研究训练数据与语言模型行为之间的关系，通过干预数据批次来测试数据与行为之间的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究训练数据如何影响语言模型行为，特别是事实知识获取方面，补充过去基于共现统计的观察性分析。

Method: 通过干预数据批次（"重写历史"），选择评估项目，匹配相关文档，修改文档后重新训练模型并测量效果。

Result: 现有识别相关训练文档的方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力，共现统计与模型行为之间存在关联但不够充分。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可复用的实验方法框架，供研究人员测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的各种假设。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

TL;DR: DEG-RAG框架通过实体解析和三重反思技术，解决基于图的知识增强生成系统中LLM生成知识图谱的噪声问题，显著提升图谱质量和问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图的知识增强生成系统依赖LLM自动构建知识图谱，但会产生包含冗余实体和不可靠关系的噪声图谱，这降低了检索和生成性能并增加计算成本，而现有研究未全面解决LLM生成知识图谱的去噪问题。

Method: 提出DEG-RAG框架，包含：(1) 实体解析：消除冗余实体；(2) 三重反思：移除错误关系。同时系统评估了实体解析的不同策略，包括分块策略、嵌入选择、相似度度量和实体合并技术。

Result: 该方法不仅大幅减小图谱规模，还在多种流行的基于图的知识增强生成变体中持续提升问答性能。

Conclusion: DEG-RAG框架通过去噪处理生成更紧凑、高质量的知识图谱，在基于图的知识增强生成系统中表现出显著优势，是首个对LLM生成知识图谱中实体解析问题的全面探索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

TL;DR: 研究发现小型多语言模型在检索任务中表现不佳，但通过优化训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性，可以开发出紧凑的300M参数模型，其检索性能达到甚至超过7B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型多语言模型在检索任务中表现落后于大型模型的问题，探索能否通过特定优化使小型模型在检索任务中表现更好。

Method: 分析训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性对多语言嵌入模型效果的影响，重点研究硬负样本的作用和任务多样性vs语言多样性的重要性。

Result: 发现增加训练数据规模初期有效但收益递减，硬负样本对提升检索准确率至关重要，任务多样性比语言多样性对性能贡献更大。开发出300M参数模型在检索性能上媲美7B模型。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的训练策略，小型多语言模型可以在检索任务中达到与大型模型相当甚至更好的性能，关键在于优化训练数据组成和负采样方法。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

TL;DR: 提出了Qwen3Guard系列安全护栏模型，包含生成式和流式两种变体，支持多语言和实时安全监控，在安全分类任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全护栏模型存在两个主要限制：1) 仅输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；2) 需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，无法兼容流式推理。

Method: 开发了两种专门变体：生成式Qwen3Guard将安全分类转为指令跟随任务，实现细粒度三分类；流式Qwen3Guard引入词元级分类头，支持实时安全监控。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全调节解决方案，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于LLM的代理检索系统，通过三个专门代理的协作来提升多跳问答中的检索精度和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要收集多个证据片段，现有检索方法在精度和召回率方面存在不足。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解多跳问题，选择器精确选择相关上下文，加法器补充缺失证据，三者通过迭代交互形成紧凑而全面的支持段落集。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue和MultiHopRAG四个多跳问答基准测试中，该方法持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 该代理检索系统能够过滤干扰内容，提高检索准确性，使下游QA模型在依赖较少无关信息的情况下超越全上下文答案准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接作为独立问题处理，显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 采用双向模式检索框架，结合表优先检索后列选择和列优先检索后表选择两种互补策略，并辅以问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等挑战性基准测试中，显著提高模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能持续优于全模式基线，接近oracle性能，无需查询优化。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，将完整模式与完美模式之间的性能差距缩小了50%。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 发现论文关键概念路径分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，提出的方法能够有效提升学术论文分析的深度和准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Motivation: 现有数学推理基准主要关注英语或少数高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理能力的评估，特别是在不同资源水平语言中的表现。

Method: 构建包含7种语言（涵盖高、中、低资源）的平行多语言基准数据集，系统评估开源和专有LLM在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现。

Result: LLM在不同语言间的数学推理能力存在显著差异，在低资源语言环境下性能明显下降，表现出跨语言数学推理的一致性和可解释性不足。

Conclusion: 多语言数学推理仍然是LLM的挑战领域，需要开发更有效的跨语言推理方法，特别是在低资源语言环境下。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，并开发了多轮强化学习方法减少77.6%的欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在客服、教育、医疗等应用中与数百万人互动，但其产生欺骗性输出的能力（无论有意还是无意）带来了严重的安全隐患。LLM行为的不可预测性，加上对幻觉、错误信息和用户操纵的防护不足，使其滥用成为严重的现实风险。

Method: 提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，在四种不同对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五种现有欺骗检测指标和新提出的指标。引入了多轮强化学习方法来微调LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗测量指标比任何现有测试指标更接近人类判断。LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，当提示欺骗时，欺骗性相对基线增加高达31%。使用RLHF训练的安全模型平均仍有43%的欺骗率。多轮强化学习方法相比其他指令微调模型减少了77.6%的欺骗行为。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的行为，其有效评估和缓解需要超越单轮话语分析。多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLMs的欺骗行为，为解决这一重要安全问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Beyond One World基准测试，用于评估LLM在角色扮演中忠实呈现不同版本角色的能力，包含30个英雄的90个版本，测试事实回忆和道德困境处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在角色扮演中能否忠实、一致地呈现特定版本的角色，特别是像漫威和DC这样的超级英雄宇宙中具有不同历史、价值观和道德准则的多个角色版本。

Method: 构建包含30个标志性英雄和90个特定版本角色的基准测试，包含两个任务：经典事件（事实回忆）和道德困境（伦理场景）。提出Think-Act Matching指标量化理由与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：(1)思维链提示能提升弱模型的叙事连贯性，但可能降低强模型的准确性；(2)角色内跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；(3)模型通常在思考或行动中表现优异，但很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

*Ziad Elshaer,Essam A. Rashed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度的多模型框架，通过模型多样性增强医疗问答性能，无需微调即可达到竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医疗大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA上达到95.0%，MedMCQA上达到78.0%的优异表现，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型合作为改进医疗AI系统提供了实用、计算高效的途径，对资源受限环境中高级医疗AI的普及具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs对结构化字符级扰动的抵抗能力，旨在防止LLM在在线考试系统等场景中的滥用，探索LLMs在低级别噪声下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出NAMESHORT方法，在文本中插入不可见Unicode控制字符，通过字符级扰动来破坏分词并降低信噪比，全面评估模型、问题和噪声相关配置。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，尽管进行了强混淆处理，许多LLM仍能保持显著性能，研究探索了字符级分词处理以及隐式与显式去噪机制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在低级别鲁棒性方面的发现，为LLM滥用风险和在不同应用中部署的可靠性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了pluri-hop问题概念，针对需要聚合所有文档的问答场景，并开发了PluriHopWIND数据集和PluriHopRAG方法，在重复性高、干扰文档多的语料上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答系统在处理需要聚合所有文档的问题时表现不佳，特别是对于医疗记录、合规文件等重复性报告数据，传统检索增强生成方法存在检索停止点不明确和遗漏敏感的问题。

Method: 提出PluriHopRAG架构，采用"单独检查所有文档，廉价过滤"策略：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器在昂贵的LLM推理前过滤无关文档。

Result: 在PluriHopWIND数据集上测试，传统RAG方法F1得分不超过40%，而PluriHopRAG相对提升了18-52%的F1得分。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND数据集揭示了当前问答系统在重复性、干扰文档丰富的语料上的局限性，PluriHopRAG的性能证明了穷尽检索和早期过滤相比top-k方法的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析Reddit用户的纵向评论树数据，结合哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评定量表，显著提升了用户自杀风险水平的识别和预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是全球重要的公共卫生问题，现有研究主要关注单条社交媒体帖子的自杀表达检测，但很少分析用户随时间变化的评论树数据来预测自杀风险演变。

Method: 构建了基于Reddit的高质量标注数据集，包含用户发帖历史和评论，采用基于C-SSRS的四标签标注框架，并进行统计分析和LLM实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，整合评论树数据能显著增强用户自杀风险水平的识别和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升高危个体检测准确性提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了有价值的基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用下一个词预测方面表现出色，但难以生成反映个人真实沟通风格的回复，如以用户自己的风格回复邮件或社交消息。由于隐私问题，真实的SNS或邮件历史难以收集。

Method: 通过基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC，构建了英语、日语和中文的100个对话会话基准，用户在五天内与NPC互动，捕捉自然的日常沟通模式。评估了基于提示和微调的个性化方法。

Result: 建立了第一个YNTP基准，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础。数据集已公开可用。

Conclusion: YNTP任务能够有效建模用户的精确词汇选择，为开发更符合用户沟通风格的语言模型提供了重要基准和基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

TL;DR: 提出MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架，通过引用感知推理、迭代检索验证和MedTrust对齐模块，有效减少生物医学问答中的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于RAG的生物医学问答系统存在幻觉问题，主要由于检索后噪声和证据验证不足，影响了回答的可靠性。

Method: 1. 引用感知推理：要求所有生成内容必须基于检索到的医学文档；2. 迭代检索验证：通过验证代理评估证据充分性并优化查询；3. MedTrust对齐模块：结合验证正例和幻觉感知负例，使用直接偏好优化强化引用基础推理。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med基准测试中，该方法在多个模型架构上均优于竞争基线，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B分别获得2.7%和2.4%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架通过系统化的证据验证和对齐优化，有效提升了生物医学问答的事实一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Motivation: 语言模型在处理多约束指令时表现不佳，现有强化学习方法依赖外部监督且面临稀疏奖励问题。

Method: 采用约束分解策略和高效的约束二元分类，直接从指令生成奖励信号和伪标签来训练奖励模型。

Result: 在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令跟随任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决多约束指令跟随问题，具有良好的泛化能力，且无需外部监督。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出Explore to Evolve范式构建可验证的Web代理训练数据，开发WebAggregator模型在信息聚合任务上超越GPT-4.1，并创建WebAggregatorQA基准评估Web代理的信息聚合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，忽视了信息聚合这一支持深度研究的关键需求，限制了其进行深入研究的能力。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：先通过主动在线探索从真实网络收集证据，然后自进化聚合程序，从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作来合成可验证的QA对。

Result: 构建了包含10K样本的WebAggregatorQA数据集，开发了WebAggregator系列模型，其中8B版本性能与GPT-4.1相当，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。在WebAggregatorQA基准上，Claude-3.7-sonnet仅得28%，GPT-4.1得25.8%。

Conclusion: Web代理在信息聚合能力上存在显著不足，即使能检索到所有参考资料，在WebAggregatorQA基准上仍表现不佳，需要加强Web代理基础模型的信息聚合能力。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序化JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能。

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成分离，使用自然语言输出替代JSON格式。

Result: 在10个模型和6,400次试验中，工具调用准确率提升18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大。

Conclusion: NLT显著改善工具调用性能，增强模型鲁棒性，并可扩展到缺乏原生工具调用支持的模型，对强化学习和监督微调训练都有重要意义。

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过锚定表示组合架构和语言耦合语义推理器，在低资源条件下提升跨语言表示能力，同时增强检索和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言上性能接近饱和，但在低资源语言上表现较差，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca的多语言表示基础上添加语言感知轻量级推理头，通过一致性正则化统一训练目标。

Result: 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）中，LiRA在少样本和噪声放大设置下均显示出持续增益和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言表示能力，同时增强了检索和推理的鲁棒性，并通过消融实验验证了Arca和LaSR的贡献。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量处理场景（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率

Method: 通过提取和重组实体级标记，丢弃大部分其他输入标记，实现压缩表示

Result: 在OntoNotes上仅比全前缀增量基线低0.6 F1分，压缩比为1.8；在LitBank上超过最先进性能

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指消解器中丢弃大部分标记是增量共指消解的可行策略

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

Motivation: 当前缺乏验证主权LLMs是否与用户社会文化背景对齐、是否保持安全性和技术稳健性的框架和数据集，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术稳健性。

Result: 实验结果表明，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面有意义，但并未完全满足服务目标用户的需求，且追求未经测试的主张可能导致低估安全等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，纳入更全面、有根据且实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 提出了WritingPreferenceBench数据集，发现当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非主观质量偏好，生成式奖励模型通过显式推理链在创意写作偏好判断上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但当移除客观质量信号时性能显著下降，需要评估模型在主观质量偏好上的真实能力。

Method: 构建包含1,800个人工标注偏好对的数据集，涵盖8种创意写作类型，确保回答在客观正确性、事实准确性和长度上匹配，比较序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型准确率仅52.7%，零-shot语言模型53.9%，而生成式奖励模型达到81.8%准确率；不同写作类型间模型方差很大，准确率从18.2%到81.8%不等。

Conclusion: 成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类，当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

TL;DR: CodeSeq是一个基于数字序列合成的后训练数据集，通过将数字序列包装成算法问题来发现通用项，并采用反思失败测试用例和迭代修正的方法生成监督微调数据，结合强化学习提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归纳推理研究面临两个挑战：现有数据主要关注表面规律而缺乏复杂内部模式；当前工作仅提示LLMs或在简单提示-响应对上进行微调，未提供精确的思考过程或实现难度控制。

Method: 构建CodeSeq数据集，定义通用项生成任务，通过反思失败测试用例和迭代修正生成监督微调数据，结合基于可解性和自导向案例生成成功率的强化学习奖励机制。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用CodeSeq训练的模型在各种推理任务上表现提升，并能保持模型的分布外性能。

Conclusion: CodeSeq通过系统化的数据生成和训练方法，有效提升了LLMs在归纳推理任务上的能力，同时保持了良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

*Qing Yang,Zhenghao Liu,Junxin Wang,Yangfan Du,Pengcheng Huang,Tong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RLAIF-SPA框架，通过强化学习从AI反馈来提升语音合成的情绪表达能力，使用ASR和LLM技术分别评估语义准确性和韵律-情绪标签对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音合成在情感表达方面仍面临挑战，现有方法依赖昂贵的情感标注或优化间接目标，导致生成的语音准确但情感平淡。

Method: 采用RLAIF机制，结合ASR和LLM技术，通过韵律标签对齐增强表达质量，考虑结构、情绪、速度和音调四个维度，并加入语义准确性反馈确保语音清晰准确。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上，RLAIF-SPA优于Chat-TTS，WER降低26.1%，SIM-O提高9.1%，人工评估提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效提升了语音合成的情感表达能力和可理解性，通过直接优化情感表达和语义准确性实现了显著改进。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

*I-Fan Lin,Faegheh Hasibi,Suzan Verberne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、无需标签的意图聚类方法，使用轻量级开源LLM生成伪标签，通过多标签分类实现聚类，无需预先知道聚类数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖商业LLM成本高且透明度有限，且通常需要预先知道聚类数量，这在现实场景中往往不可行。

Method: 首先让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上对每个文本进行多标签分类，基于同一聚类的文本会共享更多标签的假设。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法达到了与现有基线相当或更好的结果，同时保持简单和计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似度匹配更具可读性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为'nugget-as-rubric'的统一可验证范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准，用于搜索增强LLM的不同工作负载。设计了基于查询重写的自动标准构建流程，并开发了4B参数的Search-Gen-V生成验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLM奖励建模存在局限性：基于规则的奖励对表达变化脆弱且不适用于长文本任务，而生成奖励在动态语料库中设计可验证稳定奖励具有挑战性且计算成本高。

Method: 提出'nugget-as-rubric'范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准；设计自动标准构建流程，通过查询重写从静态和动态语料库中提取标准；开发Search-Gen-V生成验证器，采用蒸馏思想和两阶段训练策略。

Result: 实验结果显示Search-Gen-V在不同工作负载上实现了强大的验证准确性，使其成为搜索增强LLM的可扩展、鲁棒且高效的可验证奖励构建器。

Conclusion: 提出的'nugget-as-rubric'范式和Search-Gen-V验证器为搜索增强LLM提供了一种统一、可验证且高效的奖励建模方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

*Xinyue Ma,Pol Pastells,Mireia Farrús,Mariona Taulé*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种教机器翻译模型学习特定结构语义韵律的方法，聚焦中文被字句的负面语义韵律，通过微调多个模型提升翻译准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义韵律是由语言单位与共现搭配形成的搭配意义，与语义意义不同。由于直译词可能有不同的语义韵律，需要更多关注这一语言特性以生成准确翻译，但当前机器翻译模型无法处理此问题。

Method: 针对中文被字句创建英汉句子对数据集，展示被字句的负面语义韵律，然后使用该数据集微调OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行英汉翻译任务。

Result: 微调后的机器翻译模型在翻译不利内容时能更好地使用被字句，并避免在中性和有利内容中使用。在NLLB-600M多语言模型中，这种语义韵律知识可以从英汉翻译转移到其他语言对如西班牙语-中文。

Conclusion: 通过专门的数据集微调可以成功教机器翻译模型学习特定结构的语义韵律，且这种知识在多语言模型中具有可迁移性。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

*Xingmeng Zhao,Dan Schumacher,Veronica Rammouz,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种以人为中心的框架，通过生成用户故事和多智能体讨论，帮助人们在AI系统部署前创造性思考潜在益处和危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗领域的快速发展带来了偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问等风险，现有自动风险检测方法减少了人类参与理解危害产生机制和受影响人群的机会。

Method: 开发了基于用户故事生成和多智能体讨论的人类中心框架，在用户研究中让参与者阅读故事来识别潜在危害。

Result: 阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害类型，响应均匀分布在13种危害类型上；而未阅读故事的参与者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事叙述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和益处，并更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRubric-R1V框架通过自动收集基于评分标准的生成奖励，将强化学习与过程级监督相结合，解决了多模态大语言模型中仅奖励最终答案正确性导致的虚假推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型从感知任务发展到复杂多步推理，但基于可验证奖励的强化学习通常只奖励最终答案正确性，导致虚假推理。

Method: 提出可扩展的自聚合方法，从成功轨迹中提炼一致推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强教师模型即可构建问题特定的评分标准，联合利用基于评分标准和结果的奖励。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门评估中显著提高推理忠实度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V框架通过过程级监督有效解决了多模态推理中的虚假推理问题，实现了更好的推理性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

TL;DR: Pluto是一个评估LLM生成Verilog设计效率的基准框架，包含114个问题、自检测试平台和帕累托最优参考实现。实验显示LLM在功能正确性上表现良好（78.3%），但在综合效率（面积63.8%、延迟65.9%、功耗64.0%）上仍落后于专家设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计还需要优化面积、延迟和功耗等综合指标。现有基准缺乏优化基线和验证测试平台，无法全面评估LLM的硬件设计效率。

Method: 开发Pluto基准框架，包含114个设计问题，配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于系统评估LLM生成的Verilog代码的综合效率。

Result: 最先进的LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3%的pass@1，但在综合效率方面表现较差：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0%的eff@1，明显落后于专家实现。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究发展，当前LLM在硬件设计效率方面仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在LLM重排序任务中的效果，发现SFT在权重更新方面优于CL，在MRB基准上取得了新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT编码器使用对比学习更有效，而LLM使用监督微调更有效，这引发了关于哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的疑问。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过探测实验比较CL和SFT，并在UMR平台上进行大规模训练验证。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显差异，SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势。

Conclusion: SFT在LLM重排序中优于CL，在MRB基准上取得了新的SOTA结果，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

TL;DR: COIG-Writer是一个中文创意写作数据集，通过逆向工程高质量文本，提供包含逆向提示、详细创作推理和最终文本的三元组。研究发现创意写作需要过程监督和通用数据的结合，创意能力具有文化特异性，且词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关。


<details>

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在创意写作中的系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语环境下训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督的问题。

Method: 构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种文体，每个三元组包含逆向提示、创作推理过程和最终文本。通过实验分析创意写作的两组件模型。

Result: 发现过程监督非常有效但需要通用数据稳定（至少1:12比例）；创意能力具有文化特异性（中英文性能差距89.26%）；词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑支架和语言基础的交互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Motivation: 现有生成模型评估方法中，答案提取算法对推理模型性能评估结果影响很大，需要更可靠的方法。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型是否能有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言。

Method: 构建包含6种英语方言的4200多个提示的大规模基准测试，评估17个图像和视频生成模型，并提出基于编码器的缓解策略来识别新方言特征同时保持标准英语性能。

Result: 当前最先进的多模态生成模型在使用单个方言词时性能下降32.26%至48.17%，提出的方法能将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当（+34.4%），同时对标准英语性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在显著性能差距，但通过设计的编码器缓解策略可以有效提升方言性能而不损害标准英语表现。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on

*Guinan Su,Yanwu Yang,Li Shen,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型因部署中的分布偏移导致路由决策不理想，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，不适用于MoE架构。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：预填充阶段和定期间隔时，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；正常生成文本时保持修改后的路由器。通过轻量级加性向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在挑战性推理任务上实现一致性能提升，如HumanEval上获得5.5%改进；与现有测试时缩放技术兼容，如与自一致性结合在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上实现6%平均增益。

Conclusion: 该数据无关的在线测试时框架能有效优化MoE路由决策，提升推理性能，同时保持计算效率和上下文偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

*Emmy Liu,Graham Neubig,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究语言模型训练中的'中期训练'阶段，发现其在数学和代码领域最有效，能减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，相比持续预训练表现更好且减少遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管中期训练在实践中很流行，但对其有效性原因缺乏科学理解，需要系统研究这一训练阶段的作用机制。

Method: 通过从头预训练语言模型并在不同领域监督微调数据集上进行控制实验，分析中期训练的时间安排和混合权重的影响。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域效果最佳，能减少语法差距；早期引入专业数据比混合权重更重要，能获得更好的领域内表现并保持通用语言建模能力。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练能通过减少遗忘获得更好性能。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一个基于MLIR的开源编译器堆栈，专门为AMD NPU等细粒度空间架构设计，通过AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的结构化表示，实现空间调度和计算通信重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器在抽象并行性、局部性和同步时限制了在现代空间架构上的效率。现代计算架构需要细粒度控制数据移动、执行顺序和计算布局，编译器必须提供显式机制来协调计算和数据。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器堆栈，定义AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的结构化表示，支持空间调度、跨硬件区域计算分发以及通信与计算重叠。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；在多头注意力中，用约150行代码实现融合实现，有效映射复杂工作负载到空间硬件。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级结构化控制流转换为空间程序，有效利用NPU的计算结构和内存层次，通过编译器管理的调度实现异步执行、分块和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合合成数据生成、三元组损失和分层模型融合的新方法，显著提升RAG系统的输出一致性，在工业应用中提高47.5%的响应相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在语义等效输入下常产生不一致输出，现有训练数据稀缺且微调技术难以有效提升输出一致性。

Method: 结合系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的层级模型融合方法。

Result: 融合模型显著提升输出一致性，响应相似度相比基线提高约47.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业RAG系统可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

TL;DR: 提出了一个联合建模训练计算和上下文的下游任务性能框架，通过实证验证在三个任务上的表现，揭示了训练计算与上下文利用之间的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的扩展定律无法捕捉下游任务性能，其中上下文起着关键作用，需要一个新的框架来联合建模训练计算和上下文对下游性能的影响。

Method: 提出了一个简单可解释的框架，通过拟合Llama-2-7B和Llama-2-13B在三个任务上的65,500个实例来验证框架的有效性。

Result: 框架能够准确建模分布内下游性能，在三个数量级的训练计算上具有泛化能力，并能可靠地外推随着上下文增加的性能表现。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导，揭示了训练计算与上下文利用之间的重要相互作用。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了机器学习模型在心理健康筛查中的有效性，使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集，在抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD诊断中达到超过80%的准确率，特别在PTSD检测中表现突出（89%准确率和98%召回率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康障碍是全球致残的主要原因，但由于主观评估、临床资源有限以及污名化等问题，抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD经常被漏诊或误诊。初级保健环境中，超过60%的病例被误诊，迫切需要可扩展、易获取且情境感知的诊断工具来支持早期检测和干预。

Method: 使用553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集，评估多种机器学习模型，包括GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA的零样本提示，以及使用LoRA微调的RoBERTa模型。发现使用较短、聚焦的上下文片段能提高召回率。

Result: 模型在所有诊断类别中达到超过80%的准确率，PTSD检测表现最佳（89%准确率和98%召回率）。LoRA微调证明既高效又有效，低秩配置（如秩8和16）在各种评估指标上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模型相比传统自报告筛查工具能提供显著改进，为低门槛、AI驱动的早期诊断开辟了道路。这项工作为将机器学习整合到真实世界临床工作流程奠定了基础，特别是在资源匮乏或高污名化环境中。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Motivation: 解决现有RLVR方法需要分别生成解决方案和自我验证，导致效率低下的问题。

Method: 理论推导表明推理奖励可简化为最后一词自奖励分数，提出在RLVR损失基础上增加MSE损失来对齐最后一词自奖励分数与验证器推理奖励。

Result: 实验证明该方法不仅提升模型推理性能，还赋予其显著的自奖励能力，增强推理时的扩展性能。

Conclusion: LaSeR算法通过最小额外成本实现了推理和自我验证能力的有效联合优化，显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics

Conclusion: IGPO通过信息增益提供密集的内在监督，有效解决了多轮LLM智能体训练中的奖励稀疏问题，是简单而有效的强化学习框架。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to

TL;DR: TokDrift框架揭示了代码LLMs中由于子词分词器与语法不对齐导致的语义相同但分词不同的代码变体会引起模型行为的显著变化，这影响了代码理解和生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码LLMs使用基于统计的子词分词器（如BPE），而非基于语法，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因格式差异（如空格、标识符命名）而被不同分词，从而影响模型行为。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则创建仅在分词上不同的代码变体，评估九个代码LLMs（包括超过300亿参数的大型模型）的行为变化，并进行分层分析。

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著偏移，分层分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分词未能捕获语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 分词不对齐是代码LLMs可靠理解和生成的隐藏障碍，未来的代码LLMs需要语法感知的分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Elastic-Cache是一种无需训练、架构无关的KV缓存自适应刷新策略，通过注意力感知的漂移测试和深度感知的调度，减少扩散大语言模型中的冗余计算，显著加速解码过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和所有层都重新计算所有token的QKV，而KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：(1) 远距离MASK token主要作为长度偏置，可在活动预测窗口外进行块级缓存；(2) KV动态随深度增加，从深层开始选择性刷新足够；(3) 最受关注token的KV漂移最小，为其他token提供保守的缓存变化下界。提出Elastic-Cache策略，联合决定何时刷新（通过最受关注token的注意力感知漂移测试）和在哪里刷新（通过深度感知调度）。

Result: 在LLaDA-Instruct、LLaDA-1.5和LLaDA-V上的数学推理和代码生成任务中实现一致加速：GSM8K上8.7倍（256 token），长序列上45.1倍，HumanEval上4.8倍，同时保持比基线更高的准确率。在GSM8K上实现比现有基于置信度方法高6.8倍的吞吐量。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过自适应、层感知的缓存更新，显著减少冗余计算，在保持生成质量的同时加速扩散LLM的解码，实现实际部署。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Motivation: 当前移动机器人主要执行独立任务，本文旨在探索一种新的机器人设计范式——"弱势机器人"，通过展现脆弱性、可爱性和功能不完整性来激发公众的情感回应和协作参与，而非单纯执行任务。

Method: 通过解构功能和能力的概念，引入两个设计虚构小品：一个乌托邦弱势机器人和一个反乌托邦弱势机器人，描述它们在未来城市空间中的编排。

Result: 提出了"弱势机器人"的设计框架，展示了通过故意设计脆弱性和不完整性可以促进人机协作，激发公众的想象力和情感回应。

Conclusion: 设计决策中的价值观选择将塑造不同的社会技术未来，弱势机器人设计可以创造鼓励协作的人机共享公共空间，但需要谨慎考虑其潜在的社会影响。

Abstract: Delivering groceries or cleaning airports, mobile robots exist in public
spaces. While these examples showcase robots that execute tasks, this paper
explores mobile robots that encourage posthuman collaboration rather than
managing environments independently. With feigned fragility, cuteness and
incomplete functionalities, the so-called "weak robots" invite passersby to
engage not only on a utilitarian level, but also through imaginative and
emotional responses. After examining the workings of "weak robots" by queering
notions of function and ability, we introduce two speculative design fiction
vignettes that describe choreographies of such robots in future urban spaces --
one exploring a utopian weak robot and the other a dystopian weak robot. We
introduce these speculations in order to discuss how different values may drive
design decisions, and how such decisions may shape and drive different
socio-technical futures in which robots and humans share public spaces that
incentivise collaboration.

### [226] [Generative AI in Heritage Practice: Improving the Accessibility of Heritage Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13811)
*Jessica Witte,Edmund Lee,Lisa Brausem,Verity Shillabeer,Chiara Bonacchi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 开发了名为HAZEL的GenAI聊天机器人，专门用于修订遗产保护和解释相关的书面指南。与ChatGPT相比，HAZEL在指南编写任务中表现略优，表明微调后的LLM更有效，但在文化敏感性和专业技术方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将生成式人工智能整合到专业遗产实践中，旨在提高面向公众的指南文档的可访问性。

Method: 开发了专门针对遗产保护指南修订的GenAI聊天机器人HAZEL，并通过定量评估将其与ChatGPT在指南编写相关任务中的表现进行比较。

Result: HAZEL在性能上略优于ChatGPT，表明经过微调的大型语言模型更有效，但在文化敏感性和高级技术专业知识方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 虽然GenAI无法在技术撰写任务中取代人类遗产专业人士，但其在自动化和加速指南编写某些方面的潜力可为遗产组织，特别是在资源受限的环境中，提供有价值的益处。

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of
enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed
HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance
relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative
assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a
series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this
comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in
resource-constrained contexts.

TL;DR: MindBenchAI是一个综合在线平台，用于评估基于大型语言模型的心理健康工具，为患者、临床医生、开发者等利益相关者提供易于访问的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个人越来越多地使用基于LLM的工具替代人类专家进行心理健康指导和危机支持，但缺乏足够的经验证据表明AI技术可以作为临床替代品，因此迫切需要评估和监管此类工具。

Method: 基于MINDapps.org框架开发，扩展了技术框架以涵盖新颖的LLM功能，通过基准测试方法，并与国家精神疾病联盟(NAMI)合作，提供系统评估LLM和基于LLM的工具的评估工具。

Result: 创建了MindBenchAI平台，该平台整合评估方法，作为动态在线资源，从医疗角度使用客观透明的标准评估LLM工具的技术特征、隐私保护和临床推理技能。

Conclusion: MindBenchAI平台为不同利益相关者提供了简化LLM评估的解决方案，填补了该领域评估指标正式整合的空白，支持心理健康领域AI工具的负责任部署。

Abstract: Individuals are increasingly utilizing large language model (LLM)based tools
for mental health guidance and crisis support in place of human experts. While
AI technology has great potential to improve health outcomes, insufficient
empirical evidence exists to suggest that AI technology can be deployed as a
clinical replacement; thus, there is an urgent need to assess and regulate such
tools. Regulatory efforts have been made and multiple evaluation frameworks
have been proposed, however,field-wide assessment metrics have yet to be
formally integrated. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive online
platform that aggregates evaluation approaches and serves as a dynamic online
resource to simplify LLM and LLM-based tool assessment: MindBenchAI. At its
core, MindBenchAI is designed to provide easily accessible/interpretable
information for diverse stakeholders (patients, clinicians, developers,
regulators, etc.). To create MindBenchAI, we built off our work developing
MINDapps.org to support informed decision-making around smartphone app use for
mental health, and expanded the technical MINDapps.org framework to encompass
novel large language model (LLM) functionalities through benchmarking
approaches. The MindBenchAI platform is designed as a partnership with the
National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) to provide assessment tools that
systematically evaluate LLMs and LLM-based tools with objective and transparent
criteria from a healthcare standpoint, assessing both profile (i.e. technical
features, privacy protections, and conversational style) and performance
characteristics (i.e. clinical reasoning skills).

Motivation: 为老年群体设计严肃游戏，促进有意义的互动，并通过熟悉的音乐提供情境化体验，同时建立严肃游戏设计的系统框架。

Method: 创建Puzzlegram游戏原型，利用音乐作为核心设计元素，强调记忆、听觉互动和触觉反馈，游戏机制基于熟悉的过去音乐构建。

Result: 成功开发了Puzzlegram严肃游戏原型，为老年人提供了结合音乐的情境化游戏体验，并提出了AI集成以监控认知功能的潜在方向。

Conclusion: 严肃游戏设计应注重有意义互动，音乐是有效的设计元素，AI集成可增强游戏对认知功能的监控和适应性。

Abstract: An original serious game prototype named 'Puzzlegram' is created for the
elderly demographic in group settings as the target players. Puzzlegram is
precisely designed to accentuate memory, auditory interaction as well as haptic
response to visual signals with the use of music. Music is introduced as a key
component for establishing the game design that provides a source of meaningful
contextualization (familiar music from the past) for setting the game
mechanics, which facilitated the construction of the serious game design
process. The discussion topics raised include the need to design serious games
for fostering meaningful interactions, as well as developing a thorough
framework for constructing purposeful design for serious games. A potential
integral of artificial intelligence to Puzzlegram may involve assigning a novel
dimension to its existing problem solving task by adapting to varying states of
cognitive function for monitoring purposes based on an individual's interaction
with the game.

Motivation: 心理学研究人类认知，XAI解释机器学习模型，本研究旨在通过XAI工具分析人类学习过程，特别是在安全可靠性关键领域中的复杂任务解决策略。

Method: 通过构建粒子加速器操作员子任务图，应用社区检测和层次聚类等技术分析档案操作数据，建模人类在复杂现实任务中的行为。

Result: 揭示了操作员如何将问题分解为更简单的组件，以及这些解决问题的结构如何随着专业知识的增长而演化。

Conclusion: 阐明了人类在缺乏全局最优解的情况下如何发展高效策略，并证明了基于XAI的方法在定量研究人类认知方面的实用性。

Abstract: Both humans and machine learning models learn from experience, particularly
in safety- and reliability-critical domains. While psychology seeks to
understand human cognition, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) develops methods
to interpret machine learning models. This study bridges these domains by
applying computational tools from XAI to analyze human learning. We modeled
human behavior during a complex real-world task -- tuning a particle
accelerator -- by constructing graphs of operator subtasks. Applying techniques
such as community detection and hierarchical clustering to archival operator
data, we reveal how operators decompose the problem into simpler components and
how these problem-solving structures evolve with expertise. Our findings
illuminate how humans develop efficient strategies in the absence of globally
optimal solutions, and demonstrate the utility of XAI-based methods for
quantitatively studying human cognition.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了紧急庇护所一线工作人员面临的职业挑战，并提出通过协同设计的数据导航界面来支持他们做出以人为本的高风险决策，而非将决策完全外包给数据系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急庇护所一线工作人员面临替代性创伤、同情疲劳和职业倦怠等问题，现有技术往往不符合他们的独特需求，反而增加了工作负担。现有文献主要关注自动化决策的技术，但忽视了工作人员可能对此类自动化的抵制。

Method: 2022-2024年在加拿大一家大型紧急庇护所进行的定性实地研究，通过协同设计、开发和部署交互式数据导航界面，支持一线工作人员在无家可归者相关的高风险决策中进行协作。

Result: 研究发现庇护所行政数据在决策中的作用，揭示了工作人员不愿将弱势群体决策外包给数据系统的原因，提出了数据外包连续体的概念。

Conclusion: 设计者应创建支持非营利领域富有同情心的数据驱动决策的技术，在自动化与人工判断之间找到平衡，更好地配合以人为本的决策过程。

Abstract: Frontline staff of emergency shelters face challenges such as vicarious
trauma, compassion fatigue, and burnout. The technology they use is often not
designed for their unique needs, and can feel burdensome on top of their
already cognitively and emotionally taxing work. While existing literature
focuses on data-driven technologies that automate or streamline frontline
decision-making about vulnerable individuals, we discuss scenarios in which
staff may resist such automation. We then suggest how data-driven technologies
can better align with their human-centred decision-making processes. This paper
presents findings from a qualitative fieldwork study conducted from 2022 to
2024 at a large emergency shelter in Canada. The goal of this fieldwork was to
co-design, develop, and deploy an interactive data-navigation interface that
supports frontline staff when making collaborative, high-stakes decisions about
individuals experiencing homelessness. By reflecting on this fieldwork, we
contribute insight into the role that administrative shelter data play during
decision-making, and unpack staff members' apparent reluctance to outsource
decisions about vulnerable individuals to data systems. Our findings suggest a
data-outsourcing continuum, which we discuss in terms of how designers may
create technologies to support compassionate, data-driven decision-making in
nonprofit domains.

TL;DR: VisAider是一个AI辅助的交互式数据演示原型，通过实时分析演示上下文来生成可视化辅助建议，解决传统可视化系统在实时演示中适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式可视化系统依赖固定的用户操作与可视化命令映射，无法在实时演示中支持动态调整可视化类型、数据转换或添加数据集等丰富操作。

Method: 基于对经验数据分析师的形成性研究，开发VisAider原型，通过分析可用数据集、活动可视化、持续对话和受众画像来生成排名建议的可视化辅助。

Result: 原型在模拟场景中验证了方法的可行性，初步测试揭示了在推断适当数据转换、解决模糊可视化任务和实现低延迟响应方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 持续工作聚焦于解决这些限制，将系统集成到演示环境中，并准备总结性用户研究以评估可用性和沟通效果。

Abstract: Effective real-time data presentation is essential in small-group interactive
contexts, where discussions evolve dynamically and presenters must adapt
visualizations to shifting audience interests. However, most existing
interactive visualization systems rely on fixed mappings between user actions
and visualization commands, limiting their ability to support richer operations
such as changing visualization types, adjusting data transformations, or
incorporating additional datasets on the fly during live presentations. This
work-in-progress paper presents VisAider, an AI-assisted interactive data
presentation prototype that continuously analyzes the live presentation
context, including the available dataset, active visualization, ongoing
conversation, and audience profile, to generate ranked suggestions for relevant
visualization aids. Grounded in a formative study with experienced data
analysts, we identified key challenges in adapting visual content in real time
and distilled design considerations to guide system development. A prototype
implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in simulated
scenarios, and preliminary testing highlights challenges in inferring
appropriate data transformations, resolving ambiguous visualization tasks, and
achieving low-latency responsiveness. Ongoing work focuses on addressing these
limitations, integrating the system into presentation environments, and
preparing a summative user study to evaluate usability and communicative
impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频屏幕阅读器的顺序性质限制了用户接收和处理信息的带宽，需要开发能够提供空间信息的替代方案。

Method: 开发TapNav原型，结合触觉覆盖层和自适应听觉反馈来传达界面元素的空间信息和位置。对12名盲人和低视力用户进行评估，让他们使用TapNav探索数据可视化并与银行交易应用交互。

Result: 定性研究结果显示，触摸点和空间约束导航帮助用户更快地预期结果进行探索，并将认知负荷转移到触觉上。

Conclusion: 提供了创建触觉覆盖层的设计指南，并讨论了该技术超越探索性数据分析和日常应用导航场景的通用性。

Abstract: Screen readers are audio-based software that Blind and Low Vision (BLV)
people use to interact with computing devices, such as tablets and smartphones.
Although this technology has significantly improved the accessibility of
touchscreen devices, the sequential nature of audio limits the bandwidth of
information users can receive and process. We introduce TapNav, an adaptive
spatiotactile screen reader prototype developed to interact with touchscreen
interfaces spatially. TapNav's screen reader provides adaptive auditory
feedback that, in combination with a tactile overlay, conveys spatial
information and location of interface elements on-screen. We evaluated TapNav
with 12 BLV users who interacted with TapNav to explore a data visualization
and interact with a bank transactions application. Our qualitative findings
show that touch points and spatially constrained navigation helped users
anticipate outcomes for faster exploration, and offload cognitive load to
touch. We provide design guidelines for creating tactile overlays for adaptive
spatiotactile screen readers and discuss their generalizability beyond our
exploratory data analysis and everyday application navigation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI网络代理在执行重复任务时需要人工详细指导，无法可靠自主运行

Method: 从代理的成功和失败尝试中自动合成可重用工作流，包含执行保护机制帮助检测和修复错误

Result: 将15个任务的完成率从24.2%提高到70.1%，用户测试显示比基线方法成功率更高且需要更少指导

Conclusion: 该方法使AI代理能够以最少干预完成重复任务，同时允许用户轻松监控代理行为和理解失败原因

Abstract: AI-powered web agents have the potential to automate repetitive tasks, such
as form filling, information retrieval, and scheduling, but they struggle to
reliably execute these tasks without human intervention, requiring users to
provide detailed guidance during every run. We address this limitation by
automatically synthesizing reusable workflows from an agent's successful and
failed attempts. These workflows incorporate execution guards that help agents
detect and fix errors while keeping users informed of progress and issues. Our
approach enables agents to successfully complete repetitive tasks of the same
type with minimal intervention, increasing the success rates from 24.2% to
70.1% across fifteen tasks. To evaluate this approach, we invited nine users
and found that our agent helped them complete web tasks with a higher success
rate and less guidance compared to two baseline methods, as well as allowed
users to easily monitor agent behavior and understand failures.

Conclusion: AI助手能够成功支持用户维持专注度，使数字行为与预定目标保持一致，系统源代码已公开。

Abstract: When working on digital devices, people often face distractions that can lead
to a decline in productivity and efficiency, as well as negative psychological
and emotional impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that elicits a user's intention,
assesses whether ongoing activities are in line with that intention, and
provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. The system leverages a large
language model to analyze screenshots, application titles, and URLs, issuing
notifications when behavior diverges from the stated goal. Its detection
accuracy is refined through initial clarification dialogues and continuous user
feedback. In a three-week, within-subjects field deployment with 22
participants, we compared our assistant to both a rule-based intent reminder
system and a passive baseline that only logged activity. Results indicate that
our AI assistant effectively supports users in maintaining focus and aligning
their digital behavior with their intentions. Our source code is publicly

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过被动观察用户行为自动推断即时目标的方法，然后针对这些单一目标优化LLM输出，从而生成更符合用户需求的工具和响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在未给定具体目标时会产生平庸的结果，如充满陈词滥调的邮件草稿。需要一种方法来推断用户的即时目标并针对性地优化输出。

Method: 提出了一种架构，通过被动观察用户行为自动诱导即时目标，然后引导下游AI系统根据这些目标进行生成和评估。

Result: 在用户自身任务的实验中，JIT目标使LLM输出获得了66-86%的胜率；现场使用会话证实JIT目标能为每个参与者生成独特的专用工具。

Conclusion: 自动诱导即时目标能够使LLM生成更响应、更符合需求的工具、界面和响应，显著优于典型的LLM输出。

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

Motivation: 探索增强现实技术如何通过物理与数字世界的整合，为神经发育障碍人群创造沉浸式互动体验，帮助他们发展生活技能和认知能力。

Method: 通过两个探索性研究评估两个TAR应用：Holomarket模拟超市购物体验，训练物品选择、算术和金钱处理技能；ATOF将环境转化为海洋世界，使用海豚形状智能对象完成任务，提升运动协调和认知能力。

Result: 参与者喜欢逼真的环境和实体交互，但存在操作虚拟对象困难、长时间使用头显不适等可用性挑战。整体反馈积极，表明TAR具有治疗潜力。

Conclusion: TAR技术可作为神经发育障碍的有效治疗工具，提供吸引人的沉浸式体验。需要进一步研究改进应用设计，提升用户交互体验和舒适度。

Abstract: Tangible Augmented Reality (TAR) is an interaction paradigm that integrates
physical and digital worlds to create immersive, interactive experiences. This
paper explores two TAR applications, Holomarket and Along the Oceanic Flow
(ATOF), and presents insights from two exploratory studies evaluating their
usability and likeability among individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders
(NDD). Holomarket is designed to simulate a supermarket shopping experience,
helping users develop essential life skills such as item selection, basic
arithmetic, and money handling. Participants interacted with augmented food
items and a smart cash register, navigating a virtual supermarket environment.
While participants enjoyed the realistic setting and tangible interactions,
some usability challenges, such as difficulty manipulating virtual objects and
discomfort with prolonged headset use, were noted. ATOF transforms the user
environment into an oceanic world, where participants use a dolphin-shaped
smart object to complete tasks like collecting items and solving puzzles. This
application aims to improve motor coordination and cognitive skills.
Participants appreciated the immersive experience, the customizable tasks, and
the tangible dolphin interface. However, some faced difficulties interacting
with specific virtual elements. Overall, both applications demonstrated
potential as therapeutic tools for NDD, offering engaging and immersive
experiences. Despite some usability challenges and hardware limitations, the
positive feedback suggests that TAR could play a crucial role in future
therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to refine these
applications and enhance user interaction and comfort.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of virtual reality (VR) for enhancing
sales skills training using a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). VR
technology enables users to practice interpersonal and negotiation skills in
controlled, immersive environments that mimic real-world scenarios. In this
study, participants engaged in sales simulations set in a virtual dealership,
interacting with avatars in different work settings and with various
communication styles. The research employed a within-subjects experimental
design involving 20 university students. Each participant experienced four
distinct sales scenarios randomized for environmental and customer conditions.
Training effectiveness was assessed using validated metrics alongside custom
experience questions. Findings revealed consistent user experience and presence
across all scenarios, with no significant differences detected based on
communication styles or environmental conditions. The study highlights the
advantages of semi-immersive VR systems for collaborative learning, peer
feedback, and realistic training environments. However, further research is
recommended to refine VR designs, improve engagement, and maximize skills
transfer to real-world applications.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不同游戏设计方法对非对称多人VR游戏中玩家体验的影响，重点关注虚拟环境共享和玩家依赖关系两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR技术因其沉浸性可能导致用户与物理世界隔离，虽然已有非对称多人游戏设计来促进社交互动，但相关研究仍有限。

Method: 创建了四个版本的VR体验，通过虚拟环境共享（共享vs分离）和玩家依赖关系（相互vs单向）两个变量进行对比，对74名参与者进行了研究。

Result: 游戏设计变化影响了系统可用性、实用性UX质量、沉浸控制和内在动机等玩家体验方面。玩家角色和虚拟环境共现不会同时影响这些方面，表明玩家间的依赖程度会改变体验。

Conclusion: 玩家间的依赖关系是影响非对称多人VR游戏体验的关键因素，游戏设计应关注如何平衡玩家间的互动依赖。

Abstract: The risk of isolation in virtual reality (VR) stems from the immersive nature
of the technology. VR can transport users to entirely virtual environments,
often disconnecting them from the physical world and real-life interactions.
Asymmetric multiplayer options have been explored to address this issue and
encourage social interaction by requiring players to communicate and
collaborate to achieve common objectives. Nevertheless, research on
implementing these designs and their effects is limited, mainly due to the
novelty of multiplayer VR gaming. This article investigates how different game
design approaches affect the player experience during an asymmetric multiplayer
VR game. Four versions of a VR experience were created and tested in a study
involving 74 participants. Each version differs in terms of the sharing of
virtual environments (shared vs separated) and the players' dependency on the
experience (mutual vs unidirectional). The results showed that variations in
game design influenced aspects of the player experience, such as system
usability, pragmatic UX quality, immersion control, and intrinsic motivation.
Notably, the player roles and the co-presence in the virtual environment did
not simultaneously impact these aspects, suggesting that the degree to which
players depend on each other changes the player experience.

TL;DR: 使用主动推理作为空间指向任务的用户计算模型，在一维鼠标指向点击中验证了该方法的有效性，能够生成类似人类的指向运动，并自动适应不同目标难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索主动推理作为HCI中空间指向任务的计算用户模型，替代传统的基于最优反馈控制的模型，通过偏好分布而非显式目标来驱动行为。

Method: 构建具有连续状态、动作和观察空间的主动推理智能体，使用简单动态系统建模鼠标光标动态，包含真实感知延迟，通过最小化期望自由能量来选择动作。

Result: 智能体能够生成合理的指向运动和点击行为，端点方差与人类用户相似，能够自动适应不同目标难度而无需重新调整系统参数。

Conclusion: 主动推理为空间指向任务提供了可行的计算模型，能够整合概率性预测延迟补偿，但正确配置与连续系统交互的主动推理智能体仍具挑战性。

Abstract: We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a computational user model
for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). We
present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces,
performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple
underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic
perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based
models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy,
solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing
clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible
pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar
end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we
incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent.
The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without
the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss
the simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct
configuration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了游戏中的音频在逃避现实体验中的自我调节作用，指出音频可以调节唤醒度、标记过渡和提供结束感，但目前其促进健康逃避的潜力被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏中的逃避现实既可能促进恢复也可能导致有害回避，关键在于自我调节。音频作为常被忽视的元素，在调节玩家体验中具有核心作用，但其对健康逃避的贡献尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 识别了限制音频潜力认知的方法论和可访问性差距，并提出了解决这些差距的方法。

Result: 明确了音频在调节玩家情绪状态、标记游戏过渡和提供结束感方面的关键功能，揭示了当前研究中对音频作用的低估。

Conclusion: 鼓励研究者和开发者更刻意地将音频整合到更健康的逃避现实游戏设计和研究中，以充分发挥音频在促进积极游戏体验方面的潜力。

Abstract: Escapism in games can support recovery or lead to harmful avoidance.
Self-regulation, understood as combining autonomy with positive outcomes, is
key to this distinction. We argue that audio, often overlooked, plays a central
role in regulation. It can modulate arousal, mark transitions, and provide
closure, yet its contribution to well-being remains underexplored. This paper
identifies methodological and accessibility gaps that limit recognition of
audio's potential and outlines ways to address them. We aim to encourage
researchers and developers to integrate audio more deliberately into the design
and study of healthier escapist play.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨盲人和低视力用户在自动驾驶车辆出行过程中的信息需求，通过调查和访谈揭示了用户在导航、上车、下车三个环节的关键信息优先级，提出了基于自然语言的结构化信息传递框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆有潜力为盲人和低视力用户提供更大的独立出行能力，但需要了解他们在整个出行过程中的具体信息需求，以设计有效的无障碍交互系统。

Method: 采用问卷调查（202名BLV受访者）和深度访谈（12名BLV个体）相结合的方法，调查用户在不同出行阶段的信息需求，并确定信息呈现的优先顺序。

Result: 研究发现BLV用户在导航阶段最关注车辆品牌型号和如何找到正确车辆；上车时需要确认目的地和车载安全功能；下车时重视障碍物信息和下车侧信息。用户偏好使用自己的智能手机设备接收信息，并倾向于音频交互方式。

Conclusion: 本研究为向BLV用户提供出行相关信息提出了结构化框架，有助于设计针对每个出行环节的自然语言描述系统，最终提升BLV个体的出行能力和独立性。

Abstract: Purpose: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming a promising transportation
solution for blind and low-vision (BLV) travelers, offering the potential for
greater independent mobility. This paper explores the information needs of BLV
users across multiple steps of the transportation journey, including finding
and navigating to, entering, and exiting vehicles independently.
  Methods: A survey with 202 BLV respondents and interviews with 12 BLV
individuals revealed the perspectives of BLV end-users and informed the
sequencing of natural language information required for successful travel.
Whereas the survey identified key information needs across the three trip
segments, the interviews helped prioritize how that information should be
presented in a sequence of accessible descriptions to travelers.
  Results: Taken together, the survey and interviews reveal that BLV users
prioritize knowing the vehicle's make and model and how to find the correct
vehicle during the navigation phase. They also emphasize the importance of
confirmations about the vehicle's destination and onboard safety features upon
entering the vehicle. While exiting, BLV users value information about hazards
and obstacles, as well as knowing which side of the vehicle to exit.
Furthermore, results highlight that BLV travelers desire using their own
smartphone devices when receiving information from AVs and prefer audio-based
interaction.
  Conclusion: The findings from this research contribute a structured framework
for delivering trip-related information to BLV users, useful for designers
incorporating natural language descriptions tailored to each travel segment.
This work offers important contributions for sequencing transportation-related
descriptions throughout the AV journey, ultimately enhancing the mobility and
independence of BLV individuals.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义推理的物联网设备识别方法，将设备识别重新定义为网络元数据的语言建模任务，使用指令调优的LLaMA3模型在大型真实物联网流量数据集上取得了高精度识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备的快速扩张超出了当前识别方法的能力，给安全、隐私和网络可追溯性带来了重大风险，特别是在开放世界环境中，流量元数据往往不完整、有噪声或被故意混淆。

Method: 构建语义推理管道，将设备识别重新定义为异构网络元数据的语言建模任务；使用基于互信息和熵的稳定性评分的大语言模型集成生成高质量供应商标签；通过课程学习对量化的LLaMA3.1 8B模型进行指令调优，以支持稀疏性和长尾供应商分布下的泛化。

Result: 模型在2,015个供应商上实现了98.25%的top-1准确率和90.73%的宏观准确率，同时对缺失字段、协议漂移和对抗性操作保持鲁棒性；在独立物联网测试平台上的评估以及解释质量和对抗性压力测试表明，指令调优的LLM为大规模真实世界设备识别提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Conclusion: 指令调优的大语言模型为大规模物联网设备识别提供了一个可扩展且可解释的解决方案，能够有效应对开放世界环境中的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STDW的自训练动态加权方法，通过动态平衡源域和目标域损失贡献来增强渐进域适应的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统渐进域适应方法在知识迁移效率低和中间数据不完整方面的问题，实现从源域到目标域的平滑知识迁移。

Method: 引入动态加权机制，使用随时间变化的超参数ϱ控制域特定学习强度，结合自训练生成伪标签并优化加权目标函数进行迭代模型更新。

Result: 在旋转MNIST、颜色偏移MNIST、肖像数据集和Cover Type数据集上的实验表明，STDW优于现有基线方法。消融研究验证了动态调度ϱ的关键作用。

Conclusion: 该工作为鲁棒渐进域适应提供了理论洞见和实用框架，在动态现实场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

TL;DR: 提出Deep Edge Filter方法，通过对深度神经网络特征进行高通滤波来提升模型泛化能力，假设高频分量包含任务相关语义信息，低频分量包含领域特定偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于假设：神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，而在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差，因此通过高通滤波可以分离出更具泛化性的表示。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，分离出可泛化表示，同时保持架构完整性。

Result: 在视觉、文本、3D和音频等多个领域的实验结果显示，无论模型架构和数据模态如何，都能获得一致的性能提升。分析表明该方法诱导特征稀疏化并有效分离高频分量。

Conclusion: Deep Edge Filter通过高通滤波深度特征有效提升模型泛化能力，验证了核心假设，且在不同领域和架构中均表现出良好效果。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN是一个用于生成对抗网络的持续小样本学习框架，通过低秩适配技术减少参数数量，解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的持续学习方法如LFS-GAN在每次训练迭代时引入大量新权重，长期来看参数负担显著。需要一种既能处理小样本学习又能减少参数量的持续学习框架。

Method: 提出CoLoR-GAN框架，利用低秩张量高效适配模型到目标任务。引入LoRA技术，并进一步提出卷积层的LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA)技术来优化适配器大小。

Result: 在多个基准持续学习和小样本任务上的实验表明，CoLoR-GAN高效且达到最先进性能，同时显著减少了所需资源。

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN通过低秩适配技术成功解决了GAN中持续小样本学习的挑战，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了参数需求。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合对抗训练的统一框架，同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成建模，解决了传统联合能量模型的不稳定性和样本质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联合能量模型（JEM）在实现鲁棒分类和生成建模时存在SGLD训练不稳定、样本质量差的问题，需要一种更稳定的训练方法。

Method: 使用对抗训练替代SGLD，通过区分真实数据和PGD生成的对比样本来优化能量函数；采用协同对抗训练增强分类鲁棒性；设计两阶段训练解决批归一化与EBM训练的兼容性问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著提升对抗鲁棒性，生成质量接近扩散模型，是首个在复杂高分辨率数据集上实现高质量生成的MCMC-based EBM方法。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可作为统一框架的有效基础，同时实现视觉数据的生成和鲁棒分类，解决了JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

TL;DR: K-frames提出了一种场景驱动的关键帧选择新范式，通过预测语义连贯的查询相关片段来保持时间连续性，支持任意数量的关键帧选择以适应不同用户预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中受限于上下文窗口和计算成本，均匀帧采样导致信息丢失严重，而现有关键帧选择方法产生的帧稀疏且时间不连续，缺乏多尺度选择的灵活性。

Method: 首先构建了包含20万个视频高光片段的PeakClips数据集，然后采用三阶段渐进式课程学习：两个监督微调阶段用于时间定位和关键片段感知，接着是强化学习阶段直接优化场景驱动的预测策略。

Result: 在主要长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，K-frames提供了有效、可解释且即插即用的解决方案，支持各种规模的关键帧选择。

Conclusion: K-frames通过场景驱动的关键帧选择方法，解决了长视频理解中的信息保留和计算效率问题，为多尺度关键帧选择提供了灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标签分布学习方法主要针对单视图有标签数据，而多视图同时包含有标签和无标签数据的标签分布学习问题尚未被考虑。

Method: 首先计算每个视图的k-最近邻，然后通过整合其他视图的最近邻信息来补充当前视图的最近邻集合，最后基于补充后的最近邻集合构建基于图学习的多视图半监督标签分布学习模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL在分类性能上明显优于现有的单视图标签分布学习方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试多视图标签分布学习，通过考虑局部最近邻结构的互补性，不同视图可以相互提供局部结构信息来互补。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

TL;DR: 提出Weight Weaving方法，通过用户定义的池化函数在λ值搜索空间中汇集模型权重，无需评估数据即可改进模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无数据情况下设置缩放因子的原则性方法，研究者通常使用评估数据进行调优，这在实践中不可行。

Method: Weight Weaving技术使用用户定义的池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有模型合并方法）在λ值搜索空间中汇集模型权重，具有高度模块化特性。

Result: 在三个ViT变体和三个实验设置（视觉多任务学习、持续学习和领域泛化）中验证，该方法持续改进多个模型合并方法的性能，在无数据设置下平均准确率提升高达15.9个百分点。

Conclusion: Weight Weaving是一种即插即用的正交技术，消除了评估数据需求，显著提升了模型合并方法的性能。

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD编码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法将其视为分类任务而忽略了编码顺序。

Method: 将ICD编码分配问题重新定义为分类和排序任务，采用检索系统视角来考虑编码顺序。

Result: 模型在正确排序主要诊断编码方面的准确率达到47%（相比现有最佳方法的20%），在分类指标上微F1和宏F1得分分别为0.6065和0.2904，优于之前的0.597和0.2660。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在识别高优先级编码方面具有优越能力，证明了考虑编码顺序的重要性。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于解决逆问题中传统点对点匹配方法容易过拟合噪声的问题。该方法通过测试观测数据与当前估计所隐含的噪声分布是否统计一致来评估数据保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据保真度损失函数如均方误差或负对数似然寻求与噪声测量的点对点一致性，往往导致对噪声的过拟合。需要一种能够避免过拟合噪声的新方法。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失，用分布级校准替代点对点匹配，使用基于模型的概率分数对每个测量进行评估。该方法与现有正则化器兼容，优化方式与传统损失相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，用DC损失替代MSE损失无需提前停止训练即可获得更高PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一个统计基础扎实、性能增强的替代传统保真度损失的方法，特别适用于测量噪声分布已知且测量数据集包含大量独立噪声值的实际逆问题。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitNet蒸馏(BitDistill)是一种轻量级方法，可将现成的全精度大语言模型微调为1.58位精度(三元权重{-1,0,1})，在特定下游任务上获得接近全精度模型的性能，同时大幅减少内存占用和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全精度大语言模型在部署时面临的高内存消耗和推理延迟问题，通过极低精度量化实现高效部署。

Method: 结合SubLN模块、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏和持续预训练三个关键技术，通过蒸馏过程将全精度模型压缩为1.58位精度的三元权重模型。

Result: 在多种模型规模下，BitDistill达到与全精度模型相当的性能，同时实现10倍内存节省和CPU上2.65倍推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill为高效部署大语言模型提供了一种有效的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和存储成本。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出REAP方法，证明在生成任务中专家剪枝优于专家合并，通过考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏激活的专家混合模型参数量大导致内存开销，需要压缩专家。研究发现专家合并会引入不可约误差，而专家剪枝在生成任务中表现更好。

Method: 提出Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)剪枝准则，综合考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数来识别冗余专家。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，特别是在50%压缩率下。在代码生成和工具调用任务中实现接近无损压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是SMoE模型压缩的有效策略，REAP方法在保持生成性能的同时显著减少参数数量。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

Motivation: Clifford-可操纵CNNs的核基不完备，限制了模型表达能力，需要解决这一问题来提升等变网络的性能。

Method: 提出条件Clifford-可操纵核，通过输入特征场计算等变表示来增强核，并通过隐式参数化高效求解等变约束。

Conclusion: 条件Clifford-可操纵核有效解决了CSCNNs核基不完备的问题，显著提升了等变网络在科学计算任务中的性能。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何感知优化的噪声自适应分层学习率方案，通过估计梯度方差来动态调整各层学习率，显著加速了深度神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何感知优化器（如Muon）虽然能利用DNN的几何结构，但在同一组层内使用固定学习率，忽略了不同层间曲率异质性和训练过程中动态变化的局部曲率，导致训练效率不高。

Method: 在几何感知优化算法基础上引入噪声自适应分层学习率方案，实时估计由所选LMO诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，并据此为每组内的各层分配时变的噪声自适应学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法实现了锐利收敛率。在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果显示，相比最先进的优化器，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应分层学习率方案能够有效解决几何感知优化中固定学习率的局限性，显著加速DNN训练，特别是在transformer架构上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

TL;DR: COFFEE模型是一种新颖的时变状态空间模型，通过引入状态反馈机制实现上下文相关的选择性，同时保持并行实现能力，在长序列建模任务上显著优于Mamba架构的S6模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型存在二次复杂度和长距离依赖处理困难的问题，而现有的状态空间模型（如Mamba的S6模块）的选择性机制仅依赖于当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的上下文理解。

Method: 提出COFFEE模型，通过状态反馈机制从内部状态计算选择性，内部状态作为序列历史的紧凑表示；采用高效模型参数化，消除S6中的冗余，实现更紧凑和可训练的公式。

Result: 在induction head任务上，COFFEE以比S6少两个数量级的参数和训练序列达到接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上，仅用3585个参数就达到97%准确率，大幅优于S6。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展和高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了其在捕获长距离依赖方面的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的因果表示学习基准，使用高保真模拟视觉数据，包含约20万张图像和300万视频帧，涵盖4个领域的24个子场景，旨在弥合严格评估与现实应用之间的差距。


<details>

Motivation: 现有因果表示学习评估要么依赖简单合成数据集，要么依赖现实任务的下游性能，面临真实性和评估精度之间的困境。

Method: 创建包含静态图像生成、动态物理模拟、机器人操作和交通情况分析四个领域的高保真模拟视觉数据集，提供对底层因果结构的灵活访问。

Conclusion: 该基准为实践者和新研究者提供了选择或扩展适当CRL框架的经验见解，以解决能从CRL视角受益的现实问题。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Conclusion: FedHFT框架有效解决了联邦学习中数据和资源异构性的挑战，为个性化自然语言理解应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，这类网络捕捉了卷积神经网络或图神经网络的关键特征，旨在理解其几何特性与表达能力之间的关系。

Method: 建立稀疏maxout网络与虚拟多面体类之间的对偶关系，推导相关多面体维度的紧界，并基于此构建深度层次结构。

Result: 证明了足够深的稀疏maxout网络具有通用性，但在固定入度约束下，如果深度不足，仅靠宽度无法补偿稀疏性。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力与深度密切相关，在固定入度约束下，深度是实现通用性的关键因素，宽度无法替代深度的作用。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

Motivation: 随机对照试验依赖人工假设且分析成本高，限制了因果效应的大规模估计，可能遗漏重要但未被假设的效应。

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，突破了传统随机对照试验的限制，为大规模因果效应估计提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在允许的γ范围内，在遗憾与平均队列长度的权衡上达到最优（对数因子内），与已知供需曲线的最优策略相匹配。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network-driven robust optimisation framework that
integrates data-driven domain as a constraint into the nonlinear programming
technique, addressing the overlooked issue of domain-inconsistent solutions
arising from the interaction of parametrised neural network models with
optimisation solvers. Applied to a 1180 MW capacity combined cycle gas power
plant, our framework delivers domain-consistent robust optimal solutions that
achieve a verified 0.76 percentage point mean improvement in energy efficiency.
For the first time, scaling this efficiency gain to the global fleet of gas
power plants, we estimate an annual 26 Mt reduction potential in CO$_2$ (with
10.6 Mt in Asia, 9.0 Mt in the Americas, and 4.5 Mt in Europe). These results
underscore the synergetic role of machine learning in delivering near-term,
scalable decarbonisation pathways for global climate action.

TL;DR: 该论文首次揭示了无监督强化学习中涌现探索的机制，通过理论分析和实验验证了SGCRL算法如何通过学习表示自动塑造奖励景观来促进探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解无监督强化学习中涌现探索的机制，特别是SGCRL算法在没有外部奖励或课程的情况下如何解决长时程目标达成任务。

Method: 结合理论分析和受控实验，研究SGCRL算法的目标函数，分析其如何通过学习表示来塑造隐式奖励。

Result: 发现SGCRL通过最大化由其学习表示塑造的隐式奖励，自动修改奖励景观以在达到目标前促进探索、之后促进利用，且这些探索动态源于状态空间的低秩表示学习。

Conclusion: 对SGCRL探索机制的理解使其能够适应安全感知探索，为无监督强化学习的探索机制提供了新的理论洞见。

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-GCN架构，通过解耦节点自身传输概率与邻居干扰效应，解决传统GNN在异构多跳无线网络中吞吐量预测精度低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统p-persistent CSMA协议分析在异构多跳网络中预测吞吐量困难，简化模型低估48-62%吞吐量，精确马尔可夫链分析计算复杂度高，标准GNN因对称归一化混淆干扰效应导致63.94%误差。

Method: 设计解耦图卷积网络(D-GCN)，用可学习注意力替代均值聚合，显式分离节点自身传输概率处理与邻居干扰效应，捕捉复杂多跳干扰模式。

Result: D-GCN达到3.3%归一化平均绝对误差，优于基线方法，在精确分析方法计算不可行时仍可处理，基于梯度的网络优化达到理论最优值的1%以内。

Conclusion: D-GCN通过解耦架构有效解决无线网络吞吐量预测问题，提供可解释的邻居贡献权重，为大规模网络分析提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Motivation: 现有蛋白质相互作用预测方法计算成本高，本研究探索计算强度较低的替代方案，通过图表示学习进行下游PPI预测。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) ProtGram将蛋白质一级结构建模为全局推断的n-gram图，边权重由残基转移概率定义；2) DirectGCN定向图卷积网络，通过路径特定变换处理信息，结合可学习门控机制生成蛋白质级嵌入。

Conclusion: ProtGram-DirectGCN框架为蛋白质相互作用预测提供了一种计算效率高且性能优越的解决方案，特别适合处理复杂定向图结构。

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Result: RMM在各种数据集和模型规模上一致优于现有合并方法，显著保留低秩压缩模型的性能。

Conclusion: 将合并重新定义为生成可重构模型空间而非单一合并模型，允许在需要时恢复到各个特定任务模型。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Conclusion: OCNOpt基于动力系统和最优控制理论开辟了新的算法设计途径，证明了将深度神经网络视为动力系统视角的价值，为深度学习优化提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Conclusion: 扩散潜在编码了动态相关结构，但利用这种结构需要潜在组织并沿着潜在流形进行遍历。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: 对分子核进行首次全面谱分析，发现更丰富的谱特征并不总是提高准确性，在某些情况下甚至与性能负相关。领先特征值捕获了大部分信息特征，挑战了"更丰富谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最先进精度，但核方法因其在低数据环境中的鲁棒性和透明的理论基础仍被广泛使用。尽管在机器学习中对核谱进行了广泛研究，但对分子核的系统谱分析却很稀少。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示等七种分子性质的核岭回归进行综合谱分析，使用四种不同谱度量，并实现截断核来探索谱与预测性能的关系。

Result: 更丰富的谱特征并不一致提高准确性。对于transformer和局部3D表示，谱丰富度甚至与性能呈负相关。在许多核中，仅保留前2%的特征值就能恢复几乎所有性能，表明领先特征值捕获了最具信息量的特征。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了"更丰富谱产生更好泛化"的常见启发式方法，突出了表示、核特征和预测性能之间的微妙关系。这些发现为在数据有限的科学和实际任务中如何评估核和自监督学习方法提供了信息。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过严谨形式化分析发现，平坦极小值只能提供局部对抗鲁棒性，而非全局鲁棒性。为了维持数据流形之外的鲁棒性，损失函数需要在远离数据流形时急剧弯曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来假设平坦极小值（损失景观中低曲率区域）能提供更强的对抗鲁棒性，但这种联系一直缺乏严谨的形式化分析。

Method: 首先推导了倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，然后利用这个表达式约束损失在输入空间中的变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 实证验证了理论预测，发现对抗样本通常位于模型自信错误的大而平坦区域，揭示了控制对抗脆弱性的几何结构。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于平坦度的简化观点，提供了对其在鲁棒性中作用的细致理解：平坦度只能保证局部鲁棒性，全局鲁棒性需要损失函数在远离数据流形时急剧弯曲。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified

Conclusion: 为LLM推理能力的透明和可复现评估设立了新基准，证明了开源模型在竞争性编程中可以达到顶尖水平。

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了DR-RPO算法，一种模型无关的在线策略优化方法，用于在分布偏移下学习鲁棒策略，具有次线性遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中训练和部署环境不同的分布偏移问题，特别是在在线设置下样本效率和探索的关键挑战。

Method: 结合参考策略正则化，在软最大策略类中实现可优化性；采用d-矩形线性MDP公式，结合线性函数逼近和上置信界奖励进行乐观探索。

Conclusion: DR-RPO算法成功地将策略优化方法扩展到鲁棒强化学习领域，在理论和实证上都表现出色。

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PhysAttnNet模型，通过物理先验引导的双流注意力网络改进弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应预测，解决传统深度学习模型在未见海况下泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在预测弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应时，对未见海况的泛化能力有限，主要原因是忽略了海洋系统的自然衰减现象和波浪-结构相互作用建模不足。

Method: 提出PhysAttnNet模型，包含衰减双向自注意力模块（模拟自然衰减）、相位差引导双向交叉注意力模块（捕捉波浪-结构相互作用），并通过全局上下文融合模块整合，采用混合时频损失函数训练。

Result: 在水槽数据集上的实验表明，PhysAttnNet显著优于主流模型，跨场景泛化测试验证了模型在未见环境中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: PhysAttnNet作为海洋工程复杂系统预测模型的开发框架具有重要潜力，能够有效提升弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

TL;DR: 本文对通用型和专用型时间序列基础模型在PPG信号处理上的性能进行了全面基准测试，发现在全微调场景下专用模型胜率高出27%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型在时间序列分析中应用增多，但目前大多数是专用模型，而通用模型如MOMENT开始出现。本文旨在系统比较这两类模型在PPG信号处理上的表现。

Method: 通过51个任务（包括心脏状态评估、实验室值估计和跨模态推理）对两类模型进行7个维度的全面评估：胜率、平均性能、特征质量、调优增益、性能方差、可迁移性和可扩展性。

Result: 在全微调场景下，专用模型胜率比通用模型高出27%，在多个评估维度上表现更优。

Conclusion: 专用模型在PPG信号处理任务中表现优于通用模型，研究还提供了关于泛化性、公平性、注意力可视化和训练数据选择重要性的深入分析。

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

TL;DR: 提出了CAST框架，通过直接估计变换矩阵和频谱分析来理解Transformer层的功能，发现编码器和解码器模型在层行为上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得了显著成功，但其内部机制仍然很大程度上是黑盒子，缺乏深入理解。现有的可解释性方法各有局限，需要新的互补视角。

Method: CAST框架使用Moore-Penrose伪逆直接估计每层的实现变换矩阵，并通过六个可解释的频谱指标进行综合分析，无需使用探针分类器。

Result: 分析显示解码器模型表现出压缩-扩展循环，而编码器模型保持一致的高秩处理；核分析将层划分为三个功能阶段：特征提取、压缩和专门化。

Conclusion: CAST提供了与现有方法互补的见解，通过直接矩阵估计和频谱分析揭示了Transformer层的不同功能模式，为理解模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于扩散模型的非参数数据归因方法，通过图像块级相似度衡量训练样本对生成输出的影响，无需模型梯度或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法通常需要模型梯度或重新训练，限制了在专有或大规模设置中的适用性。

Method: 基于最优得分函数的解析形式，通过图像块级相似度测量生成图像与训练图像之间的影响，支持多尺度表示并通过卷积加速计算。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了强大的归因性能，与基于梯度的方法匹配，并显著优于现有非参数基线。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅产生空间可解释的归因结果，还揭示了训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，独立于任何特定模型。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAREBench是一个早期事件预测基准，评估多模态输入下的预测准确性和时间稳定性，发现现有方法难以同时优化这两个指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前早期事件预测系统缺乏对风险评分稳定性的评估，且主要基于表格数据，未能测试多模态输入下的轨迹行为。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），并引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 现有方法（特别是LLMs）在准确性和稳定性联合优化方面表现不佳，在高精度操作点召回率明显较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以获得临床医生在连续监测环境中的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

*Hayato Nihei,Sou Nobukawa,Yusuke Sakemi,Kazuyuki Aihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了光谱残差储层计算（SR-RC），将无学习的光谱残差方法与储层计算结合，在保持学习效率的同时提高了时间序列异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 储层计算在边缘AI应用中具有优势，但单独使用时需要过大的储层才能达到足够的异常检测性能，而注意力机制虽然能提高准确性但会损害学习效率。

Method: 将光谱残差方法（一种无学习、自下而上的注意力机制）与储层计算集成，形成SR-RC模型。

Result: 在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上，SR-RC优于传统储层计算和基于光谱残差特征提取的逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: SR-RC为在边缘AI中部署储层计算进行时间序列异常检测提供了实用方向，因为光谱残差方法与储层计算都适合硬件实现。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++是一个子流形感知框架，通过构建类隐藏特征流形的管状邻域并应用局部自适应排名来检测逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中广泛使用，隐蔽的后门攻击（中毒训练输入触发恶意行为但看起来良性）构成严重安全风险。现有防御在面对基于距离的异常或干净样本稀缺时容易失效。

Method: TED++为每个类的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量干净激活中估计局部"厚度"，然后应用局部自适应排名检测偏离可容许管的激活。通过聚合所有层的LAR调整排名，捕获输入在演化类子流形上的忠实程度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现了最先进的检测性能。即使每类只有5个保留样本，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，AUROC比次优方法提升高达14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过表征"管约束"行为，能够有效检测现有防御难以发现的隐蔽后门攻击，在数据稀缺情况下仍保持强大性能。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

TL;DR: 提出了主动可观测马尔可夫决策过程（AOMDP），允许智能体选择是否测量潜在状态，测量会揭示真实状态但可能有负面延迟影响。研究表明这种不确定性减少可以提升样本效率和最优策略价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界强化学习中，测量状态可能成本高昂且对后续结果产生负面影响，需要一种能够权衡测量成本与状态信息价值的方法。

Method: 将AOMDP建模为周期性部分可观测MDP，提出基于信念状态的在线RL算法，并使用序列蒙特卡洛方法联合近似未知静态环境参数和未观测潜在状态的后验分布。

Result: 在数字健康应用中评估算法，智能体决定何时提供数字干预和何时通过调查评估用户健康状态。

Conclusion: AOMDP框架能够有效处理状态测量的成本与收益权衡，在减少不确定性的同时考虑测量可能带来的负面延迟影响。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM：一种结合LLM引导搜索和ERM验证的程序学习框架，在样本效率和计算可行性上优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序学习中样本效率和计算可行性的平衡问题。传统方法要么搜索成本高（枚举法），要么需要大量样本（梯度训练法）

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架：使用预训练LLM生成k个候选程序，在保留数据上编译验证并选择最佳假设，无需反馈、自适应或梯度

Result: 理论证明坐标方向在线小批量SGD需要大量样本学习某些短程序；实证显示LLM-ERM仅需200样本即可解决奇偶变体、模式匹配和素数测试等任务，而SGD训练的transformer即使有10万样本也会过拟合

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，同时保持计算可行性，为学习梯度训练难以达到的简洁假设提供了实用途径

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出了DARTS-GT，一个通过可微架构搜索在Transformer注意力中实现深度异构的图Transformer架构，并开发了首个量化可解释性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图Transformer存在设计僵化、缺乏量化可解释性的问题，固定GNN类型无法充分利用深度特定组件选择，复杂架构难以区分性能提升是来自有意义模式还是虚假相关性。

Method: 通过非对称注意力设计解耦结构编码和特征表示，使用DARTS为每层选择最优GNN算子，在Transformer注意力内部实现深度异构，并开发基于因果消融的量化可解释性框架。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在4个数据集上达到最先进水平，在其他数据集上保持竞争力，发现的架构揭示数据集特定模式，且异构架构始终产生更可解释的模型。

Conclusion: 图Transformer无需在性能和可解释性之间做出选择，视觉注意力显著性与因果重要性并不总是相关，传统可视化方法可能遗漏真正重要的组件。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG在回答复杂多跳问题时，每次额外循环都会增加延迟、成本和引入干扰证据的风险，需要高效的停止策略。现有方法要么使用预定迭代次数，要么依赖不能很好反映是否还需要检索的置信度代理

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，引入基于价值的控制器Stop-RAG，使用完整轨迹的全宽度前向视图Q(λ)目标进行训练，学习有效的停止策略

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG始终优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中的关键缺失组件，基于价值的控制可以显著提高RAG系统的准确性

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Result: 推导了反向模式的函子恒等式、高阶导数的代数精确性、截断误差的显式界，并证明张量化Weil代数可以一次性计算所有混合导数，避免组合爆炸。

Conclusion: 该框架通过微分几何的视角解释AD理论，为开发结构保持的微分方法提供了基础，代码和示例已开源。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

*Andrew Zhao,Reshmi Ghosh,Vitor Carvalho,Emily Lawton,Keegan Hines,Gao Huang,Jack W. Stokes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了LLM提示优化中的投毒风险，发现基于反馈的攻击比注入查询攻击更有效，提出了无需访问奖励模型的虚假奖励攻击，并设计了轻量级高亮防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM系统在日常AI应用中广泛使用，其性能依赖于精心设计的提示。虽然LLM提示优化器通过迭代优化减少了人工努力，但这一优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用HarmBench进行系统性分析，引入无需访问奖励模型的简单虚假奖励攻击，并提出轻量级高亮防御方法。

Result: 发现系统对操纵反馈的脆弱性显著高于注入查询：基于反馈的攻击可将攻击成功率提升ΔASR=0.48。虚假奖励攻击使ΔASR从0.23增加到0.07，防御方法在不降低效用的前提下有效缓解攻击。

Conclusion: 提示优化管道应被视为一级攻击面，需要为反馈通道和优化框架建立更强的安全保障措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SHaRe-SSM（尖峰谐波共振点火状态空间模型），一种用于超长序列建模的第二阶尖峰神经网络状态空间模型，在保持性能的同时显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合尖峰神经网络（SNNs）的能效优势和状态空间模型（SSMs）在长序列建模中的能力，解决传统transformer在长序列中二次复杂度的问题。

Method: 设计第二阶尖峰SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效实现，并首次提出基于核的尖峰回归器用于超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比第二阶ANN-based SSMs节省73倍能量，在50k序列上仍保持优越性能，平均表现优于transformer或第一阶SSMs。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM为资源受限应用提供了一种高效的长序列建模解决方案，同时系统分析了共振点火SSMs中的异质性、耗散和守恒影响。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了多模态学习中不仅存在表示层的不平衡，还在决策层存在显著偏差，并提出需要在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制来解决模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习经常遭受模态不平衡问题，主导模态在联合优化过程中会压制较弱模态。研究发现这种不平衡不仅发生在表示学习阶段，在决策层也显著存在。

Method: 通过在音频-视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上进行实验，分析模型在预训练和平衡优化后仍然存在的系统性偏差，并探讨特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异。

Result: 实验表明即使经过广泛预训练和平衡优化，模型仍然对某些模态（如音频）表现出系统性偏差。这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅来自优化动态。

Conclusion: 在融合阶段聚合未校准的模态输出会导致决策层权重偏差，阻碍较弱模态有效贡献。未来多模态系统应更多关注在决策层纳入自适应权重分配机制，根据各模态能力实现相对平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了交互一致性指数(IC-index)来评估药物-靶点亲和力预测中交互方向的准确性，揭示了机器学习算法在未见药物或靶点时的交互捕获局限性，并通过实证研究验证了该指标对现有预测性能评估的补充价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的药物-靶点亲和力预测方法主要关注预测精度，但缺乏对交互方向预测能力的评估。正确捕捉交互效应对于药物分配决策至关重要，因为交互的存在意味着不同的药物-靶点组合会产生不同的总体亲和力。

Method: 提出交互一致性指数(IC-index)来评估固定预测器和机器学习算法在预测交互方向方面的性能。通过理论分析证明IC-index对无法捕捉交互的预测器具有不变性，并揭示了机器学习算法在药物或靶点身份置换等变性下的交互捕获局限性。

Result: 实验结果表明，IC-index能够有效补充现有的预测性能评估指标，揭示不同亲和力强度预测方法在交互方向预测方面的表现差异。当训练数据中未包含某些药物或靶点时，缺乏适当侧信息的算法无法有效捕捉交互效应。

Conclusion: IC-index为药物-靶点亲和力预测提供了重要的交互方向评估维度，强调了在机器学习模型中整合药物和靶点侧信息对于捕捉交互效应的必要性，为改进药物分配决策提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Motivation: MoE技术能有效扩展模型规模，但其巨大的内存开销使得压缩成为重要研究方向

Method: 从专家输出合并的角度分析专家合并，将其解释为在前向计算中插入附加矩阵，并基于此提出使用数学优化构建压缩矩阵的MergeMoE方法

Result: 在多个MoE模型上评估，MergeMoE在相同压缩比下始终优于基线方法

Conclusion: 从专家输出合并角度分析专家合并，并基于优化方法提出的MergeMoE能有效压缩MoE模型

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索神经网络剪枝后性能恢复的最佳方法，特别是针对大型语言模型，比较重构与重训练的效果，以找到计算效率与性能的最佳平衡点。

Method: 在GPT架构上进行广泛计算研究，比较不同重构粒度（单矩阵、组件级、块级）与重训练的效果，使用校准数据进行层间掩码选择和重构。

Result: 发现组件级重构（分别重构注意力和MLP）是帕累托最优方案，比完全重训练性能更好且内存需求更低；简单剪枝标准Wanda配合适当重构可超越复杂方法。

Conclusion: 重构不应一概避免，组件级重构是LLMs剪枝后性能恢复的高效方法，挑战了"不惜一切代价避免重训练"的传统观念。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Motivation: 当前生成建模方法难以准确再现地质结构特别是河流沉积物的连续性特征，而基于过程的模型虽然更准确但计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)进行生成建模，训练数据来自过程基模型模拟的河流沉积物，通过消融研究验证2D图像生成技术向3D图像生成的转移性。

Result: GAN训练保持稳定，生成的样本能够复现沉积物的非平稳性和细节特征，没有出现模式崩溃或纯粹记忆训练数据的问题。沉积时间可用于验证GAN样本是否遵循叠加定律。

Conclusion: GAN在针对特定地质结构的训练数据集上比通常认为的更稳健，探索深度生成模型如何利用地质原理如叠加定律具有很大潜力。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained

Motivation: 现有LLMs在分子优化中虽然能生成高级编辑意图，但在执行基于SMILES等非直观表示的修改时往往不准确，需要解决意图与执行之间的差距。

Conclusion: MECo通过对齐意图与执行，实现了一致、可控和可解释的分子设计，为药物发现中的高保真反馈循环和人机协作工作流奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

Motivation: 当前微调大型预训练语言模型时，噪声或偏离目标的样本会稀释监督信号。虽然小而精心选择的数据集通常能与更大数据集性能相当，但系统高效识别高价值训练数据的方法仍待探索。

Method: 核心是上下文近似(ICA)，通过在小规模精选验证集上进行上下文条件化，估计模型在候选样本上训练后的验证损失。ICA不需要参考模型或额外微调，在局部线性化下等价于向验证最优的一阶更新。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO任务中，以及不同骨干网络和数据集上，基于ICA的重加权方法持续改进模型对齐效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ICA框架为数据选择和重加权提供了理论基础和高效实现，但在快速漂移的在线策略更新方面存在局限性，为未来工作指明了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

<details>

Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习智能体在部分不可逆环境中容易产生价值高估和不稳定的问题，提高决策的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 包含两个核心机制：1) Phi(s,a)可逆性度量，量化在固定时间窗口内返回先前状态的可能性；2) 选择性状态回滚操作，当动作收益显著低于预期时返回前一个状态。

Result: 在CliffWalking v0环境中减少99.8%的灾难性跌落，平均回合回报提高55%；在Taxi v3环境中抑制99.9%的非法动作，累积奖励提高65.7%，同时显著降低奖励方差。

Conclusion: 回滚机制是实现安全和性能提升的关键组件，为安全可靠的顺序决策提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

*Eliezer da Silva,Arto Klami,Diego Mesquita,Iñigo Urteaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于先验预测矩匹配的严格方法来确定概率张量模型中的秩可识别性，将矩匹配条件转化为对数线性方程组，并应用于四种基础张量模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量分解中潜在维度（秩）的选择通常依赖启发式方法，缺乏严格的数学基础，需要一种系统性的秩可识别性分析方法。

Method: 将矩匹配条件转化为关于边际矩、先验超参数和秩的对数线性方程组，通过系统可解性来判定秩可识别性。

Result: PARAFAC/CP、Tensor Train和Tensor Ring模型的秩是可识别的，而Tucker模型的秩不可识别；对可识别模型推导了基于观测数据矩的显式闭式秩估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法为张量分解中的秩选择提供了严格的数学基础，能够有效识别不同张量模型的秩可识别性，并提供了实用的秩估计器。

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)算法，通过动态熵平衡机制解决Agentic RL中过度依赖熵信号导致的训练崩溃问题，在14个数据集上优于7种主流RL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流Agentic RL算法过度依赖熵信号来指导高不确定性工具调用步骤的自主探索，但过度依赖熵信号会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监控自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，并对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并引入熵感知优势估计。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO始终优于7种主流RL算法。仅使用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B结合AEPO在GAIA上达到47.6%(Pass@1)和65.0%(Pass@5)，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2%(Pass@1)和26.0%(Pass@5)，在WebWalker上达到43.0%(Pass@1)和70.0%(Pass@5)。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持稳定的策略熵，促进了可扩展的web agent训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

### [310] [MX+: Pushing the Limits of Microscaling Formats for Efficient Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14557)
*Jungi Lee,Junyong Park,Soohyun Cha,Jaehoon Cho,Jaewoong Sim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MX+格式，一种基于块浮点数(BFP)的非侵入式扩展，通过重新利用异常值的指数字段作为扩展尾数来提高精度，在4位精度下显著提升语言模型性能，且存储开销和速度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低比特BFP格式因块内异常值问题导致语言模型性能不佳，需要一种成本效益高且无需大幅修改软件框架的解决方案。

Method: MX+格式基于关键洞察：异常值不需要使用其元素数据类型中的指数字段，因此可将指数字段重新用作扩展尾数来提高异常值元素的精度。

Result: 评估显示MX+相比4位MX格式(MXFP4)显著提高模型性能，存储开销和速度损失可忽略，为高效LLM推理提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Conclusion: MX+是MXFP4或MXFP6的有力替代方案，通过非侵入式扩展有效解决了BFP格式中的异常值问题，在保持低成本的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: RedOUT是一个用于图分类的无监督OOD检测框架，通过结构熵减少结构冗余，提升检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据和测试数据之间的分布差异导致模型在遇到OOD样本时预测不准确，现有图OOD检测方法因结构冗余导致语义偏移而性能受限

Method: 提出RedOUT框架，集成结构熵到测试时OOD检测中，引入冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，通过最小化结构熵减少解耦的冗余

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验显示RedOUT在OOD检测上表现优异，平均提升6.7%，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上比最佳竞争对手提升17.3%

Conclusion: RedOUT通过结构熵有效减少结构冗余，显著提升了图分类中的OOD检测性能

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用Hydra（一种双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型）替代TabPFN中的Transformer，以解决Transformer的二次复杂度问题，同时通过双向方法减少对输入顺序的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在表格数据中虽然表现优异，但存在序列长度的二次复杂度问题，需要探索更高效的序列模型。状态空间模型（SSM）具有线性复杂度，但对输入顺序敏感，这在表格数据中是不理想的。

Method: 使用Hydra双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型替代TabPFN中的Transformer，通过双向上下文聚合来减少对输入顺序的依赖。

Result: 该方法有效降低了顺序依赖性，预测性能与原始TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: Hydra SSM可以成为Transformer在表格数据建模中的高效替代方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Conformal Labeling的新方法，通过控制AI标签的假发现率（FDR）来识别可被证明可信的AI预测实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型标注数据时不可避免的标签错误问题，现有选择性标注方法缺乏对AI标注质量的理论保证。

Method: 为每个测试实例构建符合性p值，通过比较AI模型的预测置信度与校准实例中AI错误标注的置信度，选择p值低于数据依赖阈值的实例。

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种任务（图像和文本标注、LLM QA）中实现了严格的FDR控制和高功效。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法能够提供理论保证，确保AI标注标签中预设比例的正确性，解决了AI标注质量缺乏可靠性的问题。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Result: 在Astex和PDBbind测试集上表现出优越的对接成功率和物理合理性，比现代大规模共折叠模型快约25倍

Conclusion: Matcha在蛋白质-配体对接中实现了速度、准确性和物理合理性的良好平衡

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统主要处理单模态文本数据，在处理包含文本、图像、表格、公式和图表的多模态非结构化文档时效果有限，需要开发能够理解跨模态语义关系的检索方法。

Method: 设计模态感知混合检索架构(MAHA)，构建模态感知知识图谱编码跨模态语义关系，结合稠密向量检索和结构化图遍历实现多模态检索。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，MAHA显著优于基线方法，ROUGE-L得分达到0.486，实现完整的模态覆盖。

Conclusion: MAHA建立了可扩展且可解释的检索框架，通过结合嵌入表示和显式文档结构，推动了RAG系统在多模态非结构化数据上的模态感知推理能力。

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer设计存在显著的通信开销，特别是在Tensor Parallelism中，每个块的MHA-MLP连接需要all-reduce通信。研究发现MHA-MLP连接可以绕过以提高效率。

Method: 提出FAL架构，将第一层MHA输出重定向到后续层的MLP输入，消除每块的MHA-MLP连接。FAL+版本还添加归一化的第一注意力输出到后续层MHA输出中，以增强MLP输入质量。

Result: FAL将多GPU训练时间减少高达44%，单GPU吞吐量提高1.18倍，困惑度优于基线GPT。FAL+在不增加训练时间的情况下实现更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+通过重新设计transformer架构有效减少了通信开销，提高了训练效率和模型质量。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

Conclusion: FedPPA能有效缓解全局与局部模型不一致性，保留客户端本地知识，在非IID设置下增强个性化鲁棒性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Seesaw框架，通过将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批量大小来替代传统学习率减半策略，在保持损失动态的同时减少串行步骤，加速大语言模型预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量大小递增（批量斜坡）是加速大语言模型预训练的有前景策略，但对于Adam等自适应优化器的最优策略尚不明确，通常需要启发式调优。

Method: 开发了批量大小调度的原则性框架Seesaw：当标准调度器要减半学习率时，Seesaw改为将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批量大小。理论上证明了SGD和归一化SGD中学习率衰减与批量大小递增的等价性。

Result: 在150M/300M/600M参数模型上，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下与余弦衰减匹配，同时将挂钟时间减少约36%，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw提供了一种原则性的批量大小调度方法，在保持训练效果的同时显著加速大语言模型预训练过程。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

*Hongzheng Chen,Bin Fan,Alexander Collins,Bastian Hagedorn,Evghenii Gaburov,Masahiro Masuda,Matthew Brookhart,Chris Sullivan,Jason Knight,Zhiru Zhang,Vinod Grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tawa是一个自动化编译器，能从高级瓦片化程序生成高性能的warp专用代码，通过异步引用抽象简化GPU数据流编程，在H100 GPU上实现优于cuBLAS和Triton的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的专用硬件单元支持高性能异步数据流执行，但传统的SIMT编程模型与此任务并行硬件不匹配，导致程序性差距。硬件级warp专业化虽能解锁峰值性能，但需要开发者手动编排复杂的低级通信和软件管道，过程繁琐易错。

Method: 提出Tawa编译器，采用新颖的IR抽象——异步引用(aref)来表达warp级通信，无需暴露低级硬件细节。自动将程序划分为生产者-消费者角色，管理复杂的数据流管道，避免侵入式内核重写。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上评估代表性LLM内核：Tawa实现高硬件利用率，相比高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核实现1.1倍加速；对于注意力工作负载，相比Triton实现1.2倍加速，性能与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核相当，但编程工作量大幅减少。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化warp专用代码生成和异步引用抽象，有效解决了GPU数据流编程的复杂性，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了开发难度。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

TL;DR: INDAGO-Nexus是一个多目标搜索方法，用于发现深度强化学习代理的多样化故障场景，相比单目标优化的INDAGO工具，能发现更多独特故障并减少故障发现时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具如INDAGO仅关注最大化故障数量，无法确保发现的故障场景具有多样性或揭示不同的错误类型。

Method: 使用多目标进化算法，联合优化故障可能性和测试场景多样性，采用多种多样性指标和Pareto前沿选择策略。

Result: 在三个DRL代理上评估：人形步行者、自动驾驶汽车和停车代理。INDAGO-Nexus在SDC和停车场景中分别比INDAGO多发现83%和40%的独特故障，所有代理的故障发现时间减少高达67%。

Conclusion: 多目标搜索方法能更有效地发现多样化故障场景，提高测试效果和效率。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了未来摘要预测（FSP）方法，通过预测长序列的紧凑摘要表示来改进语言模型的长期推理能力，相比传统下一词预测和多词预测在数学、推理和编程任务上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下一词预测（NTP）在长期推理、规划和创意写作方面存在局限，多词预测（MTP）只能捕获短程依赖关系，改进有限。需要一种能够处理长期依赖关系的方法。

Method: 提出未来摘要预测（FSP），训练一个辅助头来预测长期未来的紧凑表示。探索两种变体：手工制作的摘要（如词袋摘要）和学习的摘要（使用从右向左训练的反向语言模型生成的嵌入）。

Result: 在3B和8B参数模型的大规模预训练实验中，FSP在数学、推理和编程基准测试中相比NTP和MTP都有改进。

Conclusion: FSP通过预测长期未来的紧凑表示，有效提升了语言模型在长序列任务中的表现，为改进语言模型的长期推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统被动众包方法在干扰源定位中存在效率低下的问题，需要开发能够自适应引导移动代理收集高价值测量数据的主动定位方法，同时考虑现实环境中的障碍和移动约束。

Method: 修改A*算法为A-UCB*，将采集值纳入轨迹成本计算，生成高采集值的规划路径，结合贝叶斯优化来指导移动代理在复杂城市环境中进行主动测量。

Conclusion: 所提出的主动干扰源定位框架通过集成路径规划和贝叶斯优化，显著提高了定位效率，为复杂城市环境下的干扰源检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian
optimization with acquisition-aware path planning. Unlike passive crowdsourced
methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements
compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under
different environments.

TL;DR: SPHeRe是一种新型无监督学习方法，通过整合正交性和结构信息保留来解决传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中的问题，在图像分类、持续学习和迁移学习任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中存在连接更新无约束和缺乏反馈调节的问题，限制了其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: SPHeRe通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保留，结构信息保留损失通过轻量级投影反向传播到输入作为反馈调节，正交性约束确保更新幅度的有界性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等标准图像分类基准测试中，SPHeRe在无监督突触可塑性方法中达到SOTA性能，在持续学习和迁移学习场景中表现出强大有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，证明了无需严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构稀疏性和学习排列的方法（PA-DST），在保持高精度的同时显著提升训练和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏性虽然能加速GPU上的训练和推理，但在准确率上仍落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限。

Method: 为每个层学习一个排列矩阵，与结构化权重矩阵联合训练，应用于块状、N:M和对角线三种典型结构。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K（ViT-B/16）和WikiText-103（GPT-2）上，PA-DST在90-95%稀疏度下达到与非结构化基线相当的准确率，同时训练速度提升1.21倍，推理速度提升2.9倍。

Conclusion: 结构+学习排列的组合在准确率和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点。

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 时间序列数据具有动态特性，存在概念漂移和时间偏移两种分布偏移。现有研究主要关注时间偏移，而针对时间序列预测的概念漂移方法研究相对较少。

Method: 提出ShifTS框架，先处理时间偏移作为解决概念漂移的前提，使用软注意力机制从回望和预测时间序列中提取不变模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShifTS能持续提升无关模型的预测精度，优于现有的概念漂移、时间偏移及组合基线方法。

Conclusion: ShifTS框架通过统一处理时间偏移和概念漂移，为时间序列预测中的分布偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型依赖人工特征工程，神经网络能自动学习特征但缺乏可解释性且需要专用硬件。希望找到既能自动学习有用特征又保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 使用LLM合成特征函数（数据点到标量的代码函数），结合决策树预测器。提出两种算法：FunSearch的改进版本学习特征，以及ID3算法的变体在分裂叶节点时按需生成新特征。

Result: 在象棋位置评估、图像和文本分类等任务上，LeaPR模型学习到高质量的非神经网络预测器，性能与神经网络相当。

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一个灵活的学习范式，能够端到端学习可解释的表征，特征和预测结果都可以被轻松检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Motivation: 状态空间模型作为Transformer的替代方案，在长上下文和长序列生成中具有效率优势，但其在真正长序列生成问题上的理论局限性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 首先理论证明SSMs在纯模型下的局限性，然后提出通过外部工具交互来增强SSMs能力，并在多种任务上验证工具增强SSMs的性能。

Conclusion: SSMs在工具交互和代理设置中具有成为Transformer高效替代方案的潜力，工具访问是克服SSMs理论局限性的关键。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Motivation: 基础模型虽然具有广泛泛化能力，但容易受到对抗性扰动和后门攻击。现有防御方法需要昂贵的微调，且会降低模型在其他任务上的性能。本文研究是否能在不损害模型通用能力的前提下移除后门。

Method: 发现后门在模型权重空间中与良性任务是解耦的，基于此提出简单的反学习方法，通过隔离和擦除后门影响来移除攻击。在CLIP模型和常见对抗触发器上进行实验，支持已知攻击和未知攻击两种情况。

Result: 在已知攻击情况下，方法实现近乎完美的后门消除，同时平均保持96%的干净准确率。在未知攻击情况下，通过反向工程触发器也能成功移除后门。与现有防御方法相比，在消除效果和干净准确率之间取得更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 后门攻击在基础模型权重空间中与良性任务是解耦的，这一特性使得无需重新训练即可高效移除后门，同时保持模型在正常任务上的性能，为解决基础模型安全问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Hermite特征结构假设(HEA)框架，通过分析数据协方差矩阵和目标函数的多项式分解来预测核回归的学习曲线，并在真实图像数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究核回归在真实数据集上的学习曲线预测问题，旨在建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论框架。

Method: 提出Hermite特征结构假设(HEA)，通过分析核的特征值和特征函数来近似各向异性数据分布下的核特征结构，并应用于预测学习曲线。

Result: HEA在真实图像数据上表现良好，能够准确预测学习曲线；同时发现MLP在特征学习阶段也按照HEA预测的顺序学习Hermite多项式。

Conclusion: HEA框架证明了在真实数据集上建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端学习理论是可行的，为非平凡学习算法提供了理论分析工具。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在无导师情况下的安全学习框架，通过谨慎探索策略避免不可逆错误，在上下文赌博机中引入弃权选项来确保高风险环境下的安全部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI高风险应用中，传统序列决策理论假设所有错误都可恢复，但实际中某些错误可能造成不可逆损害。现有方法依赖导师协助，但导师并非总是可用。

Method: 提出两动作上下文赌博机模型，包含弃权选项（奖励为0）和提交选项（执行任务策略）。采用基于谨慎的算法，只在可信区域内提交，避免在证据不足时造成损害。

Result: 在独立同分布输入条件下，建立了次线性遗憾保证，理论上证明了谨慎探索在高风险环境中部署学习代理的有效性。

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够在不依赖导师的情况下，安全地在高风险环境中部署学习代理，避免不可逆损害的发生。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

*Aayush Karan,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需额外训练的推理增强方法，通过纯采样技术就能从基础模型中激发出与强化学习后训练相媲美的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注强化学习后训练中出现的新行为，但本文从不同角度探讨：是否能在推理时仅通过纯采样就从基础模型中激发出类似的推理能力，而无需额外训练。

Method: 受马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术启发，提出了一种简单的迭代采样算法，利用基础模型自身的似然性来增强推理能力。

Result: 在不同基础模型上，该方法在MATH500、HumanEval和GPQA等单次任务中提供了显著的推理提升，几乎匹配甚至超过强化学习后训练的效果，同时避免了RL后训练中多样性的崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、精选数据集或验证器，具有广泛的适用性，特别是在难以验证的领域展现出潜力。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

TL;DR: 提出了WeightLens和CircuitLens两种互补方法，通过直接分析权重和特征交互来改进神经网络电路发现，超越基于激活的分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法依赖人工检查且局限于简单任务，自动化方法常忽略特征间交互并依赖外部LLM和数据质量，需要更系统化的电路分析方法。

Method: WeightLens直接从学习权重解释特征，无需解释模型或数据集；CircuitLens捕捉特征激活如何从组件交互中产生，揭示电路级动态。

Result: WeightLens在上下文无关特征上匹配或超越现有方法性能；CircuitLens能识别仅基于激活的方法无法发现的电路级动态。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提高了可解释性鲁棒性，增强了电路的可扩展机制分析，同时保持效率和质量。

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散原理的采样器，用于加速循环深度语言模型的生成，在相同时间预算下比自回归生成更具表达能力，并能实现最高5倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索循环深度模型与扩散语言模型之间的关系，利用它们的相似性来加速循环深度模型的推理生成过程。

Method: 开发了一种新的扩散强制采样器，该采样器在每个前向传递中解码新token，同时通过循环并行细化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 该采样器可直接应用于现有的35亿参数循环深度transformer，无需调优即可实现最高5倍的加速。

Conclusion: 循环深度模型可以被自然地视为强大的连续（尽管是因果的）扩散语言模型，并为并行化推理中的额外计算提供了高效机制。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

### [342] [Identity-Link IRT for Label-Free LLM Evaluation: Preserving Additivity in TVD-MI Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14966)
*Zachary Robertson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用恒等链接函数而非传统的logit/probit变换来处理成对比较数据，通过TVD-MI方法生成二元评判决策，并证明恒等链接能更好地保持数据的可加性结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的IRT方法使用非线性链接函数（如logit、probit）处理二元比较数据，但这些变换会引入曲率破坏数据的可加性结构。本文旨在找到能更好保持TVD-MI几何特性的链接函数。

Method: 使用TVD-MI进行大语言模型的成对比较，生成二元评判决策。提出基于Gini熵最大化的剪裁线性模型，采用恒等链接函数和盒约束最小二乘公式来处理边界饱和问题。

Result: 在三个领域中，恒等链接函数产生的曲率违反中位数为0.080-0.150，显著低于logit/probit的0.245-0.588。在33%覆盖率下，获得0.117±0.008的留一RMSE，同时保持代理排名一致性（Spearman ρ=0.972±0.015）。

Conclusion: TVD-MI的几何特性最适合通过恒等映射来保持，这种方法能实现高效的大语言模型评估，并可应用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了生物信息神经网络(BINNs)在作物基因组预测和选择中的应用，通过整合数千个SNPs、多组学数据和先验生物知识，克服传统模型依赖直接映射精度有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因型到表型(G2P)模型精度有限，育种者需进行大规模昂贵田间试验。现有整合分子表型的模型虽能提高预测精度，但在基因组选择(GS)部署时缺乏中间分子数据。BINNs旨在利用训练时的多组学数据，在推理时仅需基因型数据。

Method: BINNs通过编码通路级归纳偏置，仅在训练时利用多组学数据，在推理时仅使用基因型数据。应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据，在稀疏数据条件下评估性能。

Result: BINNs在稀疏数据条件下将排序相关精度提高达56%，非线性识别GWAS/TWAS未能发现的基因。在合成代谢组学基准测试中，相比传统神经网络减少75%预测误差，正确识别最重要的非线性通路。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测精度的框架，揭示非线性生物学关系，可指导基因组选择、候选基因选择、通路富集和基因编辑优先排序。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

TL;DR: π-Flow是一种基于策略的流模型，通过修改学生流模型的输出层来预测无网络策略，实现快速准确的ODE积分，避免了传统蒸馏方法中的质量-多样性权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统少步扩散或流模型的蒸馏方法存在输出格式不匹配问题，导致复杂的蒸馏过程和质量-多样性权衡。

Method: 提出策略式流模型(π-Flow)，修改学生流模型输出层来预测网络自由策略，该策略可在未来子步产生动态流速度，无需额外网络评估即可进行ODE积分。使用模仿蒸馏方法匹配策略轨迹与教师模型。

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上达到1-NFE FID 2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow；在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B的4 NFE设置下，相比最先进的少步方法获得显著更好的多样性，同时保持教师级质量。

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单模仿教师行为实现了稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡，在少步生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，但这些框架可能不可用或不充分。需要一种新方法来基于决策一致性确定模型有效性。

Method: DOTechnique方法通过评估替代模型是否产生与高保真模型等效的决策来确定有效性区域，结合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间。

Result: 以高速公路换道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够发现仿真模型的有效性区域。

Conclusion: 该技术有潜力通过决策者上下文来支持模型有效性的发现。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否会在经典的认知科学范式——列联判断任务中产生因果幻觉，这种认知偏见被认为是许多社会问题的基础。

Method: 构建了1000个医学背景下的零列联场景数据集，让LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，对在需要准确因果推理的领域中使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

TL;DR: GammaZero是一个基于动作中心图表示框架的POMDP规划方法，能够通过在小问题上学习图结构模式，实现向更大问题的零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要领域特定的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在提供统一的图表示框架，解决POMDP规划中的可扩展性问题。

Method: 将信念状态转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和编码器-解码器架构从小问题中学习价值函数和策略，然后应用这些启发式方法指导蒙特卡洛树搜索解决更大问题。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同大小问题上与BetaZero性能相当，同时能够零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大问题，保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过图表示框架实现了POMDP规划的可扩展性，证明了结构模式学习在跨问题规模泛化中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

### [350] [Position: Require Frontier AI Labs To Release Small "Analog" Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14053)
*Shriyash Upadhyay,Chaithanya Bandi,Narmeen Oozeer,Philip Quirke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种替代性监管方法：要求大型AI实验室发布小型开放模拟模型，这些模型是从其最大专有模型中蒸馏训练得到的缩小版本，既能确保AI安全又能促进创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前沿AI模型监管提案因安全与创新的权衡而被搁置，需要一种既能确保AI安全又不阻碍创新的监管方法。

Method: 强制要求大型AI实验室发布小型开放模拟模型作为公共代理，让广泛的研究社区能够参与安全验证、可解释性研究和算法透明度工作，而无需披露完整规模的模型。

Result: 研究表明基于小型模型开发的安全和可解释性方法能有效推广到前沿规模系统，显著降低监管负担并加速安全进步。

Conclusion: 这种监管方法成本最小，利用可重用资源，同时为公共利益做出重要贡献，通过加深对模型的理解来缓解安全与创新的权衡，实现两者兼得。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标马尔可夫决策过程的共识声明生成框架，通过社会选择理论保证公平性，包括两种方法：随机生成策略保证核心稳定性，以及搜索算法最大化平等福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识声明生成框架缺乏可证明的公平性保证，无法在聚合多样化自由形式意见时提供结构性公平保障。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、令牌级马尔可夫决策过程，每个目标对应代理偏好。基于社会选择理论提出两种方法：保证事前核心的随机生成策略和最大化平等福利的搜索算法。

Result: 实验表明，基于平等福利目标的搜索生成的共识声明在代理对齐方面优于基线方法，包括Habermas Machine。

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了可证明的公平性保证，通过社会选择理论原则实现了更好的代理对齐效果。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统在利用时空依赖关系、确保运行安全和处理系统复杂性方面的关键挑战，实现碳减排、提升居住舒适度和降低能源成本的目标。

Method: 提出STEMS框架，包含两个核心组件：(1) 使用GCN-Transformer融合架构的时空图表示学习框架，捕捉建筑间关系和时序模式；(2) 结合控制屏障函数的安全约束多智能体强化学习算法，提供数学安全保证。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集上的实验表明，STEMS相比现有方法实现了21%的成本降低、18%的排放减少，安全违规从35.1%大幅降至5.6%，同时仅保持0.13的不适比例。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在极端天气条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性，在不同建筑类型中保持有效性，为协调建筑能源管理提供了安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像预测文化遗产地退化严重程度，在数据稀缺情况下实现76.9%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境压力与材料退化之间的复杂相互作用

Method: 采用改进的PerceiverIO架构，包含简化编码器(64D潜在空间)和自适应Barlow Twins损失函数，鼓励模态互补性

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比单模态方法显著提升

Conclusion: 架构简化结合对比正则化可在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve
complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary
concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to
maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在商业视频游戏中应用强化学习（RL）的挑战，提出将RL与传统行为树（BTs）结合的方法，并通过AMD Schola插件在复杂3D环境中训练多任务NPC来验证该方法的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业视频游戏中的应用仍然缓慢。本文旨在解决游戏AI社区在实际使用RL驱动NPC时面临的常见挑战，并探索RL与行为树的结合点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在Unreal Engine中训练RL代理，创建多任务NPC。提供将RL模型与行为树联合训练的详细方法，并在受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中展示各种技能。

Result: 验证了RL与行为树结合方法的可行性，成功在复杂3D环境中创建了多任务NPC，展示了该方法在实际游戏开发中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的交叉点是一个值得进一步探索的关键领域，虽然已有研究提出这种结合，但实际应用仍然罕见。本文通过实际案例证明了该方法的可行性。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床订单检索的双编码器系统，通过联合嵌入直接和语境化临床订单，实现实时、可解释的临床订单检索，无需依赖LLM重写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话混合了明确的指令和隐含的推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写会带来延迟、不稳定和不透明的问题，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化，使用重复安全对比目标进行微调，通过约束性LLM指导将签名订单与补充表述对齐，包括仅命令、仅上下文、命令+上下文、上下文+推理等。

Result: JEDA在实践中取得了显著提升，大幅优于基础编码器和最近的开放嵌入器，无查询模式对噪声具有弹性，减少了对不流畅和ASR错误的敏感性。

Conclusion: JEDA提供了一个快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将语境化上下文链接到可操作的临床订单。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

TL;DR: ARM-FM是一个利用基础模型自动生成奖励机器的强化学习框架，能够从自然语言描述中自动构建结构化奖励函数，实现任务分解和零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数设计高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。传统奖励设计需要专业知识且耗时，需要一种自动化、可组合的奖励设计方法。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器，将语言嵌入与奖励机器状态关联以实现跨任务泛化，利用奖励机器的结构化形式化实现任务分解。

Result: 在多样化挑战性环境中验证了ARM-FM的有效性，展示了零样本泛化能力，证明了自动化奖励设计的可行性。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机器，实现了从自然语言到结构化奖励函数的自动化转换，为强化学习的广泛应用提供了新的奖励设计范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个在线骚扰代理基准，包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈论的多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法和混合评估框架。研究发现越狱调优使骚扰成功率大幅提升，闭源和开源模型表现出不同的升级轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常发生在多轮交互中，需要评估LLM代理在多轮交互中的脆弱性。

Method: 构建了包含多轮骚扰对话数据集、多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法（针对记忆、规划和微调）和混合评估框架的基准测试系统。使用LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemini-2.0-flash模型进行测试。

Result: 越狱调优使骚扰成功率从57.25-64.19%提升至95.78-96.89%（Llama），从98.46%提升至99.33%（Gemini）。最常见的毒性行为是侮辱（84.9-87.8% vs 44.2-50.8%）和谩骂（81.2-85.1% vs 31.5-38.8%）。闭源模型显示出显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 多轮和基于理论的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟类似人类的骚扰动态，需要开发更强大的安全防护措施来保护在线平台安全。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为深度研究系统提供了严格的评估基础，识别了当前系统的局限性并指明了未来发展方向。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放领域智能体学习的关键因素，多角色协同进化是实现可扩展、自改进智能体的有效方法。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

### [363] [A Guardrail for Safety Preservation: When Safety-Sensitive Subspace Meets Harmful-Resistant Null-Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14301)
*Bingjie Zhang,Yibo Yang,Renzhe,Dandan Guo,Jindong Gu,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个在微调过程中保护LLM安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和抗有害空空间来防止安全行为退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在微调时容易失去预训练的安全对齐，即使使用良性数据或低秩适配也会产生有害响应，需要保护安全机制。

Method: 使用协方差预条件奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，冻结安全相关部分，并构建空空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的响应。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上微调时，有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace能有效保护LLM在微调过程中的安全对齐，在保持安全性的同时提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

TL;DR: 提出了Terrarium框架，用于在基于LLM的多智能体系统中进行细粒度的安全、隐私和安全性研究，通过重新设计黑板架构来创建模块化、可配置的测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够自动化繁琐的用户任务，但引入了新的风险，包括错位、恶意方攻击、智能体被破坏或用户数据被盗等问题。

Method: 重新利用多智能体系统中的黑板设计，创建模块化、可配置的测试平台，识别关键攻击向量（错位、恶意智能体、通信被破坏、数据投毒），并实现三个协作多智能体场景和四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，提供了快速原型设计、评估和防御迭代的工具，展示了框架在多种攻击场景下的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium框架旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，通过提供工具来快速原型设计、评估和迭代防御措施。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来识别LLM的局限性，强调将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在幻觉风险，可能产生听起来令人信服但缺乏事实有效性的回答。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维框架：(i)地图vs领土-区分现实表示与现实本身；(ii)直觉vs理性-基于双过程理论区分快速情感判断与慢速反思思维；(iii)冲突vs确认-检验观点是通过批判性测试还是简单相互验证。

Result: Rose-Frame提供了一个反思工具，使模型的局限性和用户的假设可见，支持更透明和批判性意识强的AI部署。

Conclusion: 只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类理解对齐，将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，为多智能体系统提供实时、无监督的步骤级错误检测和自我纠正，通过历史条件异常评分来防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在协作解决问题方面表现出色，但对级联错误很脆弱：单个错误步骤可能在智能体间传播并破坏整个轨迹。

Method: 采用两种互补设计：(1) 下一执行重构，从查询和交互历史预测下一步的嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；(2) 原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验，在稀疏上下文下稳定重构和异常评分。检测到异常时触发纠正智能体。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；在不同MAS框架中都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: 元认知监控和针对性纠正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，在不同架构中都能提供稳定的性能增益。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Motivation: 现有AI服务多为被动响应，无法预测用户需求。需要开发能够主动感知环境、推断意图并提供及时帮助的智能助手。

Method: 基于AI眼镜构建Alpha-Service框架，包含输入单元、中央处理单元、算术逻辑单元、内存单元和输出单元五个核心组件，采用多智能体系统实现。

Result: 通过Blackjack顾问、博物馆导览和购物搭配助手等案例研究，证明系统能够无缝感知环境、推断用户意图，无需明确提示即可提供及时有用的帮助。

Conclusion: AI4Service范式为AI从被动工具向主动伴侣的转变提供了可行路径，Alpha-Service框架展示了主动式AI服务的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

TL;DR: 本文提出IP-Merging方法，无需调优即可将数学推理能力从数学LLM直接迁移到多模态LLM中，通过识别关键推理层并投影到MLLM子空间来保持对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态LLM的数学推理能力落后于纯文本LLM，但直接使用模型融合方法会因参数空间差异导致性能下降，需要解决MLLM与LLM之间的对齐问题。

Method: IP-Merging方法：1）识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数；2）将这些参数投影到MLLM的子空间中；3）在子空间内合并参数，保持对齐性。

Result: 实验表明IP-Merging能有效提升MLLM的数学推理能力，且不损害其他功能，实现了无需调优的能力迁移。

Conclusion: IP-Merging提供了一种无需调优的方法，成功将数学推理能力从数学LLM迁移到MLLM，解决了参数空间对齐问题。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

TL;DR: Hi-Agent是一种可训练的分层视觉语言代理，用于移动设备控制，通过高层推理模型和低层动作模型的联合优化，在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，导致在新型任务或未见UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构：高层推理模型和低层动作模型联合优化。将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，并提出前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈来指导高层优化，缓解长时任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于提示式(17.7%)、监督式(54.5%)和强化学习式(71.9%)方法。在ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中表现出竞争力的零样本泛化能力，在AndroidWorld基准测试中随着骨干网络增大而有效扩展。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在移动设备控制任务中实现了最先进的性能，展示了在复杂场景中的强适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理和规划方面仍面临挑战，多智能体系统虽能提升集体推理能力，但存在推理成本高、延迟长、难以端到端训练等问题

Method: IMAGINE框架将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一模型中，通过简单的端到端训练实现能力超越

Result: 使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型，在TravelPlanner基准测试中达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著提升了推理规划性能，同时降低了模型规模和推理成本

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明这种限制实际上不会减少表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能针对直接由动作设置的谓词，而不能是派生谓词。但文献中作者经常偏离这一限制，只要求公理集是可分层的。本文旨在证明这两种变体实际上具有相同的表达能力。

Method: 提出了相应的转换方法，通过消除派生谓词的负出现，将包含负出现的公理转换为符合PDDL标准限制的形式。

Result: 证明了两种变体（严格限制和可分层的）都能表达与最小不动点逻辑完全相同的查询，表明派生谓词的负出现可以被消除。

Conclusion: PDDL标准对公理中负出现的限制实际上不会减少其表达能力，因为派生谓词的负出现可以通过转换方法被消除。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步，Helmsman系统能够有效自动化联邦学习系统的端到端合成。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架通过分类学驱动的方法有效管理提示大小，解决了工具数量增加带来的提示膨胀问题，在降低计算成本的同时保持或提升了代理性能，适用于复杂的代理系统环境。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

TL;DR: 研究探索预训练LLM代理能否成为自主实体，通过赋予其生成任务、积累知识和环境交互能力，发现其能执行复杂指令和自主任务，但仍存在提示敏感、任务重复等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM代理是否能从智能问题解决工具发展为能够自主规划、设计任务并为模糊目标推理的独立实体。

Method: 采用开放式实验设置，增强预训练LLM代理的能力，使其能够生成自身任务、积累知识并与环境广泛交互，进行定性研究。

Result: 代理能可靠执行复杂多步骤指令，跨运行存储和重用信息，提出并解决自身任务，但对提示设计敏感，易产生重复任务，无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究展示了将预训练LLM适应开放性的前景和当前局限，为未来训练代理管理记忆、有效探索和追求抽象长期目标指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ColorBench，一种基于图结构的移动代理评估框架，通过模拟真实设备交互的有限状态来实现动态行为的静态仿真，解决了现有评估方法无法全面评估复杂移动任务的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 提出了改进方向和可行技术路径，基于实验结果增强代理在复杂长时程问题上的性能。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对2021-2025年荷兰公共卫生机器学习研究中的算法偏见进行了系统文献综述，开发了RABAT评估工具，发现普遍存在公平性框架缺失等问题，并提出了ACAR四阶段框架来应对算法偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域有巨大潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏见，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。需要评估当前研究中对算法偏见的识别、讨论和报告情况。

Method: 开发了RABAT评估工具，整合了Cochrane偏见风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表等成熟框架，对35篇同行评审研究进行了系统分析。

Result: 分析显示存在普遍差距：虽然数据采样和缺失数据实践有良好记录，但大多数研究缺乏明确的公平性框架、亚组分析以及对潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了ACAR四阶段公平性导向框架，为公共卫生机器学习从业者提供可操作建议，确保算法创新促进健康公平而非损害公平。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在网络安全威胁、行为和防御之间进行清晰可逆的推理，需要一种能够连接自然语言查询与结构化知识图谱推理的框架。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测文本中的逻辑关系链，并使用图执行器遍历TITAN本体来检索事实答案和支持证据，基于MITRE构建的类型化双向图。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示TITAN能够生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，可在底层图上确定性地执行。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询与结构化知识图谱推理的连接，支持在网络安全领域进行可解释的推理。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Motivation: 解决现有AI伦理模型局限于人类中心主义的问题，让智能体能够在不确定环境中发展出情境敏感、自适应和关系性的伦理行为，而不预设人类道德直觉。

Method: 提出神经符号架构，结合主动推理和符号推理，使智能体能够评估在不确定环境中的行为伦理后果，通过最小化全局期望自由能量来形式化伦理行为。

Result: 通过伦理资源分配的案例研究展示了NAEL能够动态平衡自我保存、认知学习和集体福利，实现自适应伦理决策。

Conclusion: NAEL框架为人工智能系统提供了一种非人类中心主义的伦理推理方法，能够产生情境敏感和自适应的伦理行为，突破了传统伦理模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

TL;DR: COUP算法配置方法的实证性能改进，使其在保持理论保证的同时，在实用性能上与启发式配置方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COUP作为一种功利主义算法配置方法，虽然具有强大的理论保证，但在实际性能方面关注不足，需要改进以与广泛使用的启发式配置方法竞争。

Method: 对COUP进行一系列改进，提升其经验性能而不损害理论保证，并通过实验验证改进效果。

Result: 改进后的COUP在保持理论保证的同时，实证性能显著提升，能够与无性能保证的启发式配置方法竞争。

Conclusion: 通过改进COUP，成功将理论基础的功利主义算法配置方法推向实用化，并展示了如何评估算法选择方案对效用函数变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法中的任务向量包含任务无关冗余，导致合并模型性能下降，而现有去冗余方法存在随机性和缺乏知识感知的问题

Method: 通过上下文导向的奇异值分解，在知识感知子空间中将微调模型权重分解为任务相关和冗余组件，然后剪枝冗余组件来净化任务向量

Conclusion: PAVE方法通过知识感知的任务向量净化，有效解决了模型合并中的冗余问题，显著提升了合并模型的性能

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

<details>

Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要基于非结构化文本预训练，缺乏对结构化地理实体和序列移动模式的理解，且工业级POI推荐需要融入世界知识和人类认知对齐（如季节、天气、假期、用户画像等）来提升用户体验和推荐效果。

Method: CoAST框架包含两个阶段：(1) 推荐知识获取：在去敏感化的用户时空轨迹数据上进行持续预训练；(2) 认知对齐：通过监督微调和强化学习将认知判断与人类偏好对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的离线实验和AMAP App首页"猜你去哪"功能的在线实验证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST框架能够有效整合世界知识、时空轨迹模式和用户画像，通过认知对齐提升下一个兴趣点推荐的性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度波束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升大语言模型在函数调用等结构化输出任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在函数调用等结构化输出中的应用尚未充分探索，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建首个细粒度函数调用过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励；开发ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分单个函数调用的内部步骤；结合细粒度波束搜索进行推理扩展。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型；配备ToolPRM的推理扩展技术显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索但少保留"，这是由结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复性特征决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SimKO方法来解决RLVR中的过度集中问题，通过不对称地调整正确和错误回答的概率分布来改善探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在系统性偏向利用而非探索的问题，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K下降。研究发现这是由于词汇候选的概率过度集中在top-1候选上。

Method: 提出SimKO方法：对于已验证正确的回答，提升top-K候选的概率；对于已验证错误的回答，对top-1候选施加更强的惩罚。该方法特别适用于高熵的token。

Result: 在各种数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，SimKO方法在广泛的K值范围内都获得了更高的pass@K性能。

Conclusion: SimKO提供了一种简单有效的方法来缓解RLVR中的过度集中问题，从而改善模型的探索能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个代理系统，通过交互式循环选择性请求必要信息，大幅减少LLM处理NL2SQL任务时的token使用量，降低成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长、token数量多、处理成本高。

Method: 采用代理系统设计，使用交互式循环和推理框架，选择性请求必要信息来解决表格问答任务。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表格问答任务上的评估显示，token使用量减少高达87%，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent能显著降低LLM处理NL2SQL任务的成本，同时维持良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在规划任务中面临常识和推理能力受限的挑战，特别是在复杂真实环境中的长视野操作任务。监督微调存在泛化能力差和物理理解不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段微调框架：监督训练从专家序列获取基础知识，然后使用强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足。设计了基于规则的奖励函数，同时考虑长视野性能和动作约束。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练得到的推理模型，在EmbodiedBench基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini 21.33%，并超过其他在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练的工作20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架通过结合监督训练和强化学习，有效提升了具身智能体在复杂环境中的推理和规划能力，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过增加指令遵循率来提高LLM提示指令的可靠性，在2条指令时提升7个百分点，10条指令时提升4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常通过修改提示来影响LLM行为，但仅添加更多指令无法保证它们会被遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试，包含最多10条指令的数据样本，同时开发定量冲突评分工具分析指令冲突。

Result: Instruction Boosting显著提高了指令遵循率，同时发现随着指令数量增加，性能下降的主要原因是指令间的紧张和冲突程度增加。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting有效提升LLM指令遵循能力，冲突评分工具为开发者提供了评估额外提示指令对模型性能影响的反馈机制。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM辅助的迭代搜索提供了一个系统化的形式描述框架，能够有效衡量搜索过程和智能体性能。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search

### [390] [The Gatekeeper Knows Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14881)
*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架，通过低保真潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真上下文的方式，解决LLM代理在复杂知识系统中面临的上下文窗口限制和状态同步问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时，受限于有限的上下文窗口和状态不同步问题，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测，特别是在与代码库和文档等大型结构化知识系统交互时效率低下。

Method: 设计Gatekeeper Protocol框架，让代理先在低保真潜在状态表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需请求高保真上下文。所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行，作为声明式、状态同步的协议。

Result: 在软件开发的参考实现Sage中验证了协议的有效性，显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: 该协议为在任何结构化知识领域构建更稳健、可预测和接地气的AI代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

*Wen-Kwang Tsao,Yao-Ching Yu,Chien-Ming Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的智能体，能够在没有标注数据或模型权重更新的情况下自我改进，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来收集外部证据，迭代优化模式映射准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要整合来自多个第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档在测试时常常不可用、不匹配、格式混乱或不完整，导致模式映射变得困难。

Method: 使用强化学习智能体，在推理过程中：1)识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励来迭代优化映射。

Result: 将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式，映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%(100次迭代后)，同时将需要专家评审的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种证据驱动、透明的解决方案，为更稳健、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、适应性强和协作的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式验证器虽然性能优秀但计算成本过高，限制了实际应用，需要寻找更高效的验证策略

Method: 采用判别式验证器与自一致性结合的混合方法，在固定计算预算下进行测试时扩展

Result: 在AIME2025上实现了15.3%的准确率提升，显著优于最先进的生成式验证方法

Conclusion: 预算感知的判别式验证不仅是对自一致性的免费升级，而且是比昂贵生成式技术更有效和高效的替代方案

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症自动检测研究存在范围有限、缺乏系统特征比较、评估协议不一致等问题，需要系统探索多模态特征表示和建模策略。

Method: 系统评估手工特征与预训练嵌入、不同神经编码器、单/双/三模态配置及融合策略，重点关注EEG的作用，采用一致的受试者独立划分确保稳健可复现的基准测试。

Result: 结果显示：(i) EEG、语音和文本多模态组合增强多模态检测；(ii) 预训练嵌入优于手工特征；(iii) 精心设计的三模态模型达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态抑郁症检测的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数(H-Risk)来衡量推理系统的稳定性，发现高H-Risk预测过度自信错误，并将该框架应用于大语言模型分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论联系起来，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过度自信提供原则性框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk，结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大等指标，在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: 在线性高斯模拟中，高H-Risk预测过度自信错误；在LLMs中，脆弱的内部动态与误校准和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉有混合影响。

Conclusion: 建立了康德自我限制与反馈控制之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和选择性减少推理系统中的过度自信提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和外部工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过MCTS构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局结果评估，仅用10%的数据量就超越了现有最佳PRM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型面临三大挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标的不对齐。传统方法依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估或存在信用分配问题的蒙特卡洛估计。

Method: 1) 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建结构化推理路径以减少奖励噪声；2) 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤消除幻觉监督；3) 设计混合奖励聚合机制融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4) 将奖励信号格式化为增强推理的生成结构。

Result: 仅使用4万个自动标注样本（最佳PRM数据量的10%），在ProcessBench上实现了高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至超越了使用人工标注监督训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM提供了一个可扩展且可验证的路径，能够实现高质量的过程级推理，解决了现有PRM方法的核心局限性。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否能够学习创造复杂机器，特别是在组合式机器设计任务中，这既是人类智能的标志，也是工程实践的基础。

Method: 引入BesiegeField测试平台，基于Besiege游戏构建，支持部件组装、物理模拟和奖励驱动评估。对最先进的LLM进行基准测试，并探索强化学习微调方法。

Result: 当前开源模型在空间推理、策略组装和指令遵循等关键能力上表现不足，强化学习微调显示出改进潜力，但仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 在语言、机器设计和物理推理的交叉领域，LLMs在机器设计任务中仍有改进空间，强化学习是可行的改进路径，但需要解决相关挑战。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，结合人类制作和AI生成的假内容，通过类别感知MoE适配器和归因思维链机制实现跨类型检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人类制作和AI生成的假内容分开研究，导致模型只能检测单一类型，而真实场景中内容类型未知，需要统一的检测方案。

Method: 构建OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知MoE适配器捕获类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制定位欺骗信号。

Result: UMFDet在两种欺骗类型上都实现了稳健一致的性能，优于专用基线模型。

Conclusion: UMFDet为真实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Motivation: 链式思维提示在大型语言模型中推广了逐步推理，但随着问题复杂性和上下文长度的增加，模型性能仍然下降。多智能体范式通过将复杂任务分解为更短、更易管理的任务，提供了有前景的解决方案，但此类系统的基本能力尚未得到充分理解。

Result: 确定了通信有益的场景，描述了智能体数量和带宽之间的权衡，并揭示了当任一资源受限时的内在限制。实验结果证实了理论预测的关键量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 分析为设计可扩展的多智能体推理系统提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has popularized step-by-step reasoning in large
language models, yet model performance still degrades as problem complexity and
context length grow. By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into
shorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising
near-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such
systems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework
to analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to
three algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We
derive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly,
(ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the
achievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify
regimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between
agent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either
resource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of
experiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical
outcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory.
Collectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable
multi-agent reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 呼吁社区超越静态范式，共同塑造下一代适应性、社会感知的多智能体模拟系统。

Abstract: What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt,
and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering
multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities
for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current
simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by
predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These
limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies.
In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally
inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures
that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as
balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling
to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving
field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness,
continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI
ecosystems. \textbf{We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms
and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent
simulations.}

TL;DR: LLM多智能体系统需要从局部代理级对齐转向全局系统性协议，将责任视为涵盖协议、不确定性和安全性的全生命周期属性，需要结合主观人类价值观和客观可验证性，并通过跨学科设计和人机协作监督的双视角治理框架来确保系统责任。

Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统在分布式推理、协作和任务泛化方面具有潜力，但也带来了协议不可保证、级联不确定性和对抗性漏洞等风险，需要确保系统负责任的行为。

Method: 提出从局部代理级对齐到全局系统性协议的范式转变，将责任概念化为涵盖协议、不确定性和安全性的全生命周期属性，结合主观人类价值观和客观可验证性，采用跨学科设计和人机协作监督的双视角治理框架。

Result: 将LLM多智能体系统视为统一的动态社会技术系统，需要原则性机制来支持责任的每个维度，实现道德对齐、可验证一致性和弹性行为，以维持系统范围的协议。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统需要系统性的责任保障机制，通过结合价值观与可验证性的方法以及双视角治理框架，确保系统在整个生命周期中的负责任行为。

Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) unlock new potentials in
distributed reasoning, collaboration, and task generalization but also
introduce additional risks due to unguaranteed agreement, cascading
uncertainty, and adversarial vulnerabilities. We argue that ensuring
responsible behavior in such systems requires a paradigm shift: from local,
superficial agent-level alignment to global, systemic agreement. We
conceptualize responsibility not as a static constraint but as a lifecycle-wide
property encompassing agreement, uncertainty, and security, each requiring the
complementary integration of subjective human-centered values and objective
verifiability. Furthermore, a dual-perspective governance framework that
combines interdisciplinary design with human-AI collaborative oversight is
essential for tracing and ensuring responsibility throughout the lifecycle of
LLM-MAS. Our position views LLM-MAS not as loose collections of agents, but as
unified, dynamic socio-technical systems that demand principled mechanisms to
support each dimension of responsibility and enable ethically aligned,
verifiably coherent, and resilient behavior for sustained, system-wide
agreement.

Motivation: 现有LLM系统在公共资源池游戏中通常为智能体提供明确的奖励函数，而人类合作往往在没有完全了解收益和群体信息的情况下，通过启发式、沟通和惩罚机制产生。

Method: 引入包含文化演化机制（社会学习和基于规范的惩罚）的CPR模拟框架，智能体通过环境反馈从收获、监控和惩罚的后果中学习，使规范内生演化。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究混合动机LLM社会中涌现规范提供了严谨测试平台，可为AI系统在社会和组织环境中的设计提供参考，其中与协作规范的协调对稳定性、公平性和有效治理至关重要。

Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs)
explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where
pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work
has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and
simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool
resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly
tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without
full visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics,
communication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that
removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms:
social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and
norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance.
Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring,
and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge
endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key
findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine
norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social
initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and
benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these
conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining
cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed
for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can
inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts,
where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and
effective governance of AI-mediated environments.
