### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了微调的传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用多模态大语言模型进行视觉理解任务，特别是在数据有限的情况下，以充分发挥LLM在动态上下文推理和语言引导提示方面的优势。

Method: 在人工文本叠加检测任务上，对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，特别关注LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）下的微调效果。

Result: 微调多模态LLM仅需少量数据即可实现高达36%的准确率提升，性能达到或超过需要大量数据的CNN基线模型。

Conclusion: LLM方法在数据效率和适应性方面具有显著优势，为低资源视觉环境中的多模态Transformer应用提供了实用指导，证明了语言引导模型在精确视觉理解任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展。

Method: 在公开MRI数据集上使用U-Net进行分割实验，采用焦点损失函数，并评估水平翻转、旋转和缩放三种数据增强技术的影响。

Result: 使用焦点损失的U-Net实现了90%的精确度，与最先进结果相当。

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究建立了一个透明、可复现的基准，为未来脑肿瘤分割中增强策略和损失函数设计的研究提供指导。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种通过调整初始噪声来减少文本到图像扩散模型记忆训练数据的方法，既能降低记忆化又能保持图像与文本的对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)会导致图像与提示对齐不佳，需要促进更早逃离记忆化吸引盆地。

Method: 基于初始噪声样本决定逃离时间的观察，提出两种策略：集体或个体调整初始噪声，找到能促进更早逃离吸引盆地的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像与文本的对齐质量。

Conclusion: 初始噪声在控制扩散模型记忆化行为中起关键作用，通过适当调整初始噪声可以有效缓解记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的代表性偏见，特别是职业场景中的性别刻板印象，比较了DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个AI图像生成工具的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在可视化创作方面提供了巨大机会，但现有研究主要关注创建过程和质量，忽视了代表性偏见问题。随着AI图像工具日益普及，解决和减轻有害的性别偏见对于确保媒体和专业环境中的多样化表征至关重要。

Method: 研究通过生成超过750张AI职业图像，使用DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个工具，并进行主题分析来评估代表性偏见。

Result: 分析结果显示，DALL-E 3和Ideogram都在AI生成的图像中强化了传统的性别刻板印象，尽管程度有所不同。AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要解决AI生成图像中的性别偏见问题，并为从业者、个人和研究人员提出了增加可见性别图像生成中代表性的建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在VAR模型中引入动态专家混合路由机制，通过尺度感知阈值减少计算冗余，实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在递增分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致计算冗余，需要提高计算效率。

Method: 集成动态专家混合路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略平衡专家选择，无需额外训练。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，加速11%推理速度，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 动态专家混合路由能有效提升VAR模型的计算效率，实现计算质量权衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中显著提升OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但混淆了认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，容易将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能够准确分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从中提取认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比预测熵方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降至40%（减少36%）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效分离了认知和偶然不确定性，显著提升了无监督OOD检测性能，无需额外数据或训练，具有实用价值。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够以最先进精度识别已知活动，同时拒绝未知活动，并提供超越二元分类的层次化定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在训练数据中标注活动与实际生活中活动范围之间的巨大差距，未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱分类器的可靠性。此外，并非所有活动类别都同样不同，有些类别存在显著重叠或包含子活动。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，能够识别已知活动并拒绝未知活动，同时允许将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 开发了新的公开数据集NFI_FARED，包含多个受试者执行19种不同情境下的活动数据，支持开放集HAR研究。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR不仅实现了开放集分类，还提供了超越二元"已知/未知"分类的洞察力，通过层次化方法提升了活动识别系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的高频振荡(HFOs)自动检测方法，使用无监督聚类技术从时频域中识别HFOs事件，在癫痫患者中显示出与手术结果更强的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HFOs是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别耗时费力且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 采用无监督聚类技术对S变换提取的时频域事件进行分类，区分HFOs与尖峰、背景活动和伪影，检测频率范围为80-500Hz。

Result: 在控制数据集上达到97.67%灵敏度、98.57%精确度和97.78% F值；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs率比值为0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除HFOs（特别是快速波纹）可导致无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [9] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文分析了DINOv2视觉模型的内部表示机制，通过稀疏自编码器构建了32,000个概念词典，发现模型表示具有功能专业化特征，并提出了基于凸混合原型的Minkowski表示假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于物体、场景和动作识别，但其内部感知机制仍不明确。研究者希望理解模型如何表示和处理视觉概念。

Method: 采用线性表示假说，使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)构建32,000个单元的词典，分析下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究表示的几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现功能专业化：分类任务利用"Elsewhere"概念实现否定逻辑；分割任务依赖边界检测器；深度估计使用三种单眼深度线索。表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假说，认为token是通过凸混合原型形成的，这基于Gardenfors的概念空间理论，为理解视觉变换器表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光照），在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以处理遥感图像采集过程中复杂的异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含渐进式退化挖掘和利用机制，使用残差流形投影器(RMP)和频率感知退化分解器(FADD)从流形几何和频率角度分析退化特征，引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集(MD-RSID、MD-RRSHID、MDRS-Landsat)上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四个修复任务中均取得最优性能，同时显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，全面超越了现有最先进方法，为遥感图像一体化修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床决策中整合多模态医学数据的挑战，克服现有视觉语言模型在医学领域开发中的流程不透明、数据稀缺和架构不灵活等问题。

Method: 基于统一patch-based视觉编码器和LLM解码器，使用1670万样本进行渐进式训练，从2D扩展到3D和视频理解，采用医学感知的token减少技术实现高效训练。

Conclusion: 通过开源完整流程证明高性能医学VLM可以透明实现，为可访问和有影响力的临床AI提供基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，集成了语言回归和扩散生成，能够从任意视角解释和创建场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。作者希望开发一个统一的模型来弥合相机与视觉语言之间的模态差距。

Method: 引入将相机视为语言的新范式，使用Puffin-4M数据集（400万视觉-语言-相机三元组）进行训练，结合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射，实现灵活可靠的空间生成。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，通过指令调优能够泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心方法推进了多模态空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集管道和基准测试。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结内部网络结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医学图像分类任务中取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层的方法虽然计算高效，但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据极少时仍可能导致过拟合。

Method: 提出SOR框架，冻结内部网络结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少的额外参数使模型适应特定数据。

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务上评估SOR，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络，相比已有基准取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注特定领域如规划或空间理解，缺乏对MLLM具身能力的全面系统评估。需要填补这一空白，系统评估MLLM在物理世界中的感知、理解和交互能力。

Conclusion: BEAR基准填补了MLLM具身能力评估的空白，BEAR-Agent有效增强了MLLM的具身能力，为构建更强大的具身智能体提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种受生物视觉机制启发的对抗防御框架，通过模拟人眼的注视点-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充机制来增强深度学习模型的鲁棒性，无需重新训练分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗防御方法计算成本高，而人类视觉系统通过生物机制天然具有对抗扰动的鲁棒性，因此探索生物启发的防御策略。

Method: 使用强化学习引导的眼跳运动选择性捕获多个注视点-外周图像片段，通过皮层填充机制重建图像，然后进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了多种分类器和攻击类型下的系统鲁棒性，同时显著降低了训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理方法能有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练下游分类器，可无缝集成到现有系统中。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性地解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的训练不稳定性和感知-失真权衡问题，实现了高效且高质量的生成式超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度(O(N^2))，造成计算瓶颈。线性注意力提供O(N)解决方案，但历史上因一系列相互关联的未解决问题而未能实现逼真的超分辨率效果。

Method: 1. 使用基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调(ESGF)策略解决训练不稳定性；2. 采用基于SNR的专家混合(MoE)架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3. 建立轻量级TAG指导范式，遵循"精度优先于数量"原则。

Result: LinearSR模型同时实现了最先进的感知质量和卓越效率。其核心扩散前向传播(1-NFE)达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为逼真超分辨率领域提供了应用线性注意力的稳健方法，为未来高效生成式超分辨率研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发基于AI的非侵入性高效识别方法。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法提取代表性关键帧。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可解释的驾驶意图预测框架VCBM，通过新的多模态数据集DAAD-X和概念瓶颈模型，为自动驾驶系统提供时空一致的解释，无需后处理技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类交互增加，决策过程的可解释性对安全驾驶至关重要。深度学习系统缺乏对环境和驾驶任务底层表示的理解，这限制了人机交互的效果。

Method: 构建DAAD-X多模态数据集，包含驾驶员眼动和车辆视角的层次化文本解释；提出Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM)框架，直接生成时空一致的解释；使用transformer模型并与CNN模型对比；引入多标签t-SNE可视化技术。

Result: 在DAAD-X数据集上的评估表明，基于transformer的模型比传统CNN模型具有更好的可解释性；提出的VCBM框架能够有效生成时空一致的解释；多标签t-SNE可视化成功展示了多个解释之间的解耦和因果关联。

Conclusion: VCBM框架为自动驾驶系统的可解释驾驶意图预测提供了有效解决方案，transformer架构在可解释性方面优于CNN，提出的方法能够促进人机交互的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Q-Router，一个用于通用视频质量评估的智能框架，通过多层级模型路由系统动态选择专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型的泛化性差、可解释性有限和可扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于直接分数监督的VQA模型存在三个主要问题：(1) 对不同内容和任务的泛化能力差，包括用户生成内容、短视频和AI生成内容；(2) 可解释性有限；(3) 缺乏对新用例或内容类型的可扩展性。

Method: Q-Router采用多层级模型路由系统，集成多种专家模型，使用视觉-语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型。系统基于计算预算构建多层级路由，最重层级涉及特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Result: 大量实验表明，Q-Router在各种基准测试中匹配或超越了最先进的VQA模型，同时显著提高了泛化能力和可解释性。在基于质量的问题回答基准Q-Bench-Video上表现优异，并能够有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router展示了作为下一代VQA系统基础的潜力，能够结合专业专家的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中提供一致性能，并有望作为视频生成模型后训练的奖励函数。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法在模态对齐、难负样本处理和知识融合方面存在不足，缺乏统一解决方案，且可能引入无关信息

Method: 1) 多级多模态统一对齐方案；2) 使用软标签的难负样本挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等数据集上超越了之前的SOTA方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一模态对齐、改进难负样本处理和选择性知识融合，有效提升了Med-VQA任务的性能

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

TL;DR: SkipSR是一种加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在处理视频时计算成本高且速度慢，限制了向更高分辨率和更长视频的扩展。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益很少，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过选择性跳过低细节区域的计算，为视频超分辨率提供了一种简单而有效的加速策略，在保持感知质量的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临挑战，因为需要处理密集且时间延长的视觉输入，这超出了基于图像模型的能力。论文识别了感知瓶颈和令牌过载是主要挑战。

Method: 提出D-CoDe框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 动态压缩 - 通过自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间令牌聚合来减少冗余；2) 问题分解 - 将原始查询重新表述为子问题，引导模型关注视频的不同方面。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe在各种基准测试中有效提升了视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色，显示了处理复杂视频语言任务的潜力。

Conclusion: D-CoDe通过动态压缩和问题分解的协同作用，成功解决了视频大语言模型中的感知瓶颈和令牌过载问题，为图像预训练模型向视频领域的扩展提供了有效的训练免费适配方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 蔓越莓生长监测通常依赖人工操作，耗时且效率低。深度学习虽然有望解决此问题，但面临高维特征难以解释和需要大量标注数据的挑战。

Method: 使用自监督方法微调视觉变换器，通过时间回归和类别预测的双重预训练任务，学习植物和果实外观随时间演化的潜在空间表示。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于其他作物和场景，同时提供了一个包含8个品种、52次观测的蔓越莓时间序列数据集。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种在双曲空间乘积上的ℓ₁-乘积度量方法，能够同时表达概念家族内的层次结构和跨概念家族的组合语义结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念家族内的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和跨概念家族的组合性（如"车里的狗"⊆狗、车）。虽然双曲空间能有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其对组合性的表达能力尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP采用双曲因子笛卡尔积上的ℓ₁-乘积度量。概念家族内的层次结构在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念家族的组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕捉，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间乘积和ℓ₁-乘积度量的设计，成功解决了同时表达层次结构和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一个新的迁移攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射语义信息来生成增强样本，从而提高对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割模型在白盒设置下对对抗样本具有显著脆弱性，但现有攻击方法在不同分割模型间的迁移性较差。复杂上下文依赖性和特征分布差距导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些增强样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes数据集、四种分割模型和三种骨干网络上，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提高100%以上。

Conclusion: SegTrans通过局部语义信息重映射有效提升了对抗样本的跨模型迁移能力，且不引入额外计算开销，在迁移攻击成功率和计算效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ASVP方法，通过奇异值分解对图像修复模型的内部特征图进行扰动，有效防御知识蒸馏攻击，在保持教师模型性能的同时显著降低学生模型的学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击对深度模型知识产权构成严重威胁，现有防御方法主要针对图像分类任务，难以扩展到图像修复这类生成式任务，因为修复任务需要连续高维输出且依赖空间一致性和细节保持。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系，同时保持教师模型输出质量。

Result: 在超分辨率、低光增强、水下增强、去雾和去雨五个图像修复任务上的实验表明，ASVP可将学生模型的PSNR降低高达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，而对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像修复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准测试，包含通过编辑风格、对象、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样化且时间相关的反事实视频数据。

Result: 评估8个最新视频MLLMs发现，在反事实视频内容上性能显著下降；通过反事实数据微调，在Ro-Bench上性能提升21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效提升MLLMs的视频理解能力，强调了鲁棒性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Method: 开发了对象聚焦的数据增强框架，分割动物与背景，通过变换和基于扩散的合成来创建真实多样的场景，提升动物检测和监测性能。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过生成领域特定数据，该方法能够在数据稀缺场景中实现实时动物健康监测，弥合有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过增强视觉感知过程来提升大视觉语言模型的感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在视觉感知任务中精度有限，推理时缩放技术对感知提升效果不明显，需要新的感知范式来改善这一状况。

Method: 提出PTS范式，鼓励丰富的token感知，将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的子问题，结合强化学习技术提升感知精度。

Result: PTS将DisTANCE基准的高精度性能从8.0%提升到64.7%，在域外任务中泛化良好，即使使用纯合成数据也能提升数学推理和真实世界感知能力。

Conclusion: PTS通过增强感知过程显著提升了视觉感知精度，增加了感知相关token数量并提高了模型对图像token的关注度。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式表示传感器数据依赖程度，提高可解释性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波姿态估计中稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型过度依赖统计先验而非传感器数据，这会降低下游任务（如手势和活动识别）的性能。

Method: 在预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出基础上，添加额外的关节描述符，估计关节被感知的可能性和预测位置的可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置下使用超过115,000个信号帧进行评估，mmJoints描述符估计错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式表示姿态估计中的偏差，有效提高了姿态估计的准确性和下游任务的性能，同时增强了系统的可解释性。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法精度有限，现有的多向量检索方法在图像对象对齐和细粒度图像片段冗余方面仍存在不足

Method: 采用分层范式处理不同图像对象以增强对齐，利用跨层级相似性一致性和层级稀疏性减少冗余匹配，自动配置数据集参数

Result: 在准确性上取得显著提升，同时将计算量减少至现有MVR系统的1/3.5

Conclusion: HiMIR框架在图像检索中实现了准确性和效率的双重提升，适用于多样化场景

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务HandEval，通过HandPair数据集训练，利用MLLM和手部关键点先验知识，显著提升了手部质量评估能力，并在图像生成和AIGC检测中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是手部）的细节生成上仍存在结构扭曲和不真实纹理的问题，而手部区域的质量评估被忽视，限制了人类中心生成质量优化和AIGC检测等下游任务的性能。

Method: 1) 构建HandPair数据集，包含48k高质量和低质量手部图像对；2) 开发HandEval模型，结合多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力和手部关键点先验知识；3) 构建人工标注测试集验证模型性能。

Result: HandEval在质量评估上比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中分别显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: HandEval作为首个手部质量评估模型，在多个下游应用中展现出通用有效性，为提升生成图像手部质量和AIGC检测性能提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI着色技术虽然强大，但存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行着色并转售。目前缺乏有效方法来防止此类滥用。

Method: 提出PAChroma方法，通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化的输入变换来增强跨模型迁移性和对常见后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的第一步，为生成媒体中的版权感知防御开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token-by-token解码过程导致推理速度缓慢，需要数千次模型前向传递来生成单张图像，存在效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并通过低成本微调预测下一个干净token；在推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间执行迭代的next-clean-token预测，使用概率标准并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功解决了自回归模型推理效率低下的问题，实现了并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了生成速度。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 提出对抗扰动方法识别不确定视觉标记，并在视觉编码器中间层的自注意力过程中掩码这些标记，抑制其对视觉编码的影响。

Result: 实验表明该方法能显著减少LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有方法协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来识别和抑制不确定视觉标记，是减轻物体幻觉的有效策略。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过多模态知识训练单模态3D-CNN的方法，用于动态手势识别。通过让不同模态的网络协作学习，使用时空语义对齐损失和焦点正则化参数来避免负知识迁移，提升单模态网络的性能。

Motivation: 现有方法通常显式组合多模态信息，本文提出一种不同框架，将多模态知识嵌入到单个网络中，使每个单模态网络都能获得性能提升。

Method: 为每个可用模态分配单独网络，强制它们协作学习具有共同语义和更好表示的网络。引入时空语义对齐损失(SSA)来对齐不同网络的特征内容，并使用焦点正则化参数进行正则化以避免负知识迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架提高了单模态网络的测试时识别准确率，并在多个动态手势识别数据集上提供了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功地将多模态知识嵌入到单模态网络中，通过协作学习和正则化技术实现了性能提升，为动态手势识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Conclusion: 所提出的熵信息解码策略能够有效解决自回归图像生成中的采样问题，在保持高质量生成的同时显著提升效率，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DGLSS-NL任务，即带噪声标签的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化，并开发了DuNe双视图框架，在三个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注常因传感器缺陷、遮挡和人为错误而存在噪声，这种噪声会降低分割精度，并在领域偏移下进一步放大，威胁系统可靠性。

Method: 提出了DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，强制特征级一致性，并基于置信度感知的预测过滤应用交叉熵损失。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，整体算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中展示了鲁棒的领域泛化能力，为LiDAR语义分割中的噪声标签问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

Conclusion: 该后训练策略易于适配预训练潜在扩散模型，在多样化医学图像转换任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的AHFF和PSSM组件有效增强了局部几何上下文学习，实现了更精确的点云法向量估计。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了复杂场景下的多目标跟踪挑战。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

TL;DR: 该论文提出Dense2MoE方法，将密集的扩散变换器转换为混合专家结构，通过选择性激活参数来减少推理开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但参数量大导致推理开销高。现有剪枝方法会因模型容量减少而导致性能下降，需要一种既能减少激活参数又能保持容量的方法。

Method: 将DiT中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，减少62.5%的激活参数；提出混合块选择性地激活DiT块；设计多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、负载均衡的知识蒸馏和MoB优化的组特征损失。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，激活参数减少60%，同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式，通过结构化稀疏化在减少计算开销的同时保持模型容量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉分组任务依赖大型标注数据集，但这些数据集成本高、覆盖偏差大且难以扩展。合成数据缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 基于对象中心组合策略，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，产生准确多样的掩码、边界框和参考表达式。

Result: 在10万张SOS合成图像上训练的模型，在检测和定位任务上超越了GRIT（2000万）和V3Det（20万）等大型真实数据集，LVIS检测提升+10.9 AP，gRefCOCO定位提升+8.4 N_Acc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下改善泛化能力，为具有挑战性的类内视觉定位提供针对性数据生成。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），一种可分离的正交变换，解决了极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法（如Zernike和伪Zernike矩）存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性的问题，特别是在大阶数时，这限制了其在高阶矩分析中的应用。

Method: 通过张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角向基，实现完全核分解，使得径向和角向处理可以独立进行。

Result: PSepT将计算复杂度降低到O(N² log N)，内存需求降低到O(N²)，条件数缩放降低到O(√N)，在结构化数据集上表现出更好的数值稳定性、计算效率和竞争性的分类性能。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架使得之前经典方法无法实现的高阶矩分析成为可能，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因能够提供细粒度的、测试特定的解释：识别导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示传统归因方法未能暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法为理解深度模型内部工作机制提供了新的视角，能够发现传统方法无法揭示的问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Conclusion: 提出的图像基支气管镜拓扑定位方法能够有效提供导航辅助，无需患者CT扫描，仅通过模拟数据训练即可获得良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Motivation: 实例级识别需要精细的个体对象识别，但大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了其实际应用。需要克服数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化的对象实例，包含不同条件和背景，构建大规模训练集，不依赖任何真实图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为实例级识别提供了高效有效的数据收集替代方案，仅需目标领域名称即可生成训练数据，开启了新的ILR范式。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names

### [54] [TARO: Toward Semantically Rich Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173)
*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的目标检测框架，不仅能够识别未知物体，还能在语义层次结构中将其分类为粗粒度的父类别，解决了传统开放集检测将所有未知物体视为单一类别的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代目标检测器主要基于"封闭世界"假设，只能识别预定义类别的物体，在真实场景中遇到新物体时存在风险。现有开放集检测方法虽然能识别未知物体，但将所有未知物体归为单一类别"Unknown"，这在安全关键场景中信息量不足。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：1）基于sparsemax的头部建模物体性；2）层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督；3）分类模块学习层次关系。该框架能够将未知物体分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别。

Result: 实验表明TARO能够将高达29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别中，显著减少了未知类别与已知类别之间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面都取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功地将未知物体分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，为安全关键应用提供了更丰富的决策信息，相比传统单一"Unknown"分类具有显著优势。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

*Johann-Friedrich Feiden,Tim Küchler,Denis Zavadski,Bogdan Savchynskyy,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频深度估计方法oVDA，通过借鉴LLM的缓存和掩码技术，在保持高精度的同时显著降低VRAM使用，实现实时边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Video Depth Anything (VDA)依赖批处理无法在线运行的问题，使其适用于实时应用场景。

Method: 采用LLM技术：推理时缓存潜在特征，训练时掩码帧，实现高效在线处理。

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上均优于现有在线视频深度估计方法，在A100上达到42FPS，Jetson边缘设备上达到20FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功将批处理深度估计方法转化为在线版本，为边缘设备部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

TL;DR: 本文首次对板球击球动作分类的七种深度学习方法进行了系统比较，发现文献中声称的高准确率与实际情况存在显著差距，并通过现代架构实现了92.25%的最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 板球击球动作分类在体育视频分析中仍具挑战性，需要有效建模时空特征。现有文献中的准确率声称与实际性能存在较大差距，需要标准化评估。

Method: 比较了七种深度学习方法：传统CNN-LSTM、注意力模型、视觉变换器、迁移学习和现代EfficientNet-GRU组合，使用PyTorch Lightning实现标准化评估。

Result: 文献声称的准确率（96%、99.2%、93%）与实际复现结果（46.0%、55.6%、57.7%）存在显著差距。现代EfficientNet-B0与GRU组合达到92.25%的最佳准确率。

Conclusion: 现代架构结合系统优化可显著提升性能，标准化评估协议对体育视频分析研究至关重要，所有实现遵循MLOps实践确保可复现性。

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于多模态深度学习框架的牛只行为识别系统，通过语义线索提升视频特征识别性能，在监督学习下达到96.1%的准确率，并在少样本场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康、生产力和福祉的重要指标。视频监测结合深度学习已成为主流方法，但现有方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务上表现不足，需要开发更有效的多模态学习框架。

Method: 基于CLIP大规模图像-语言模型，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专用文本提示来解决预训练模型与真实监控视频之间的领域差距。

Result: 在CattleBehaviours6数据集上，监督学习下总体准确率达到96.1%，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，在少样本场景中展现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP框架为数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能。该架构包含专门为时空瞬态测量设计的注意力机制，并开发了针对LOS和NLOS成像的两个具体实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光子效率成像中3D重建的挑战，包括传感器量子效率低、噪声水平高，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下。

Method: 设计了时空自注意力编码器和时空交叉注意力解码器，通过在不同尺度上分割或下采样输入特征来探索局部和全局相关性，并在令牌空间中整合这些特征。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上的广泛实验表明，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT架构有效提升了光子效率成像的3D重建性能，同时贡献了大规模合成LOS数据集和真实世界NLOS测量数据，促进了该领域的数据多样性。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型从自身生成的错误中学习，解决了训练与推理阶段的假设差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减轻累积误差，但仅限于单提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。根本挑战在于训练假设（基于干净数据）与自回归推理现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的关键差异。

Method: 提出错误回收微调，通过闭环回收将Diffusion Transformer自生成的错误转化为监督提示，鼓励模型主动识别和修正自身错误。具体包括：注入历史错误干预干净输入；通过一步双向积分高效近似预测；动态将错误存入重放内存供新输入使用。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调有效解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件设置方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: 提出TEMA-LLM框架，结合大语言模型进行语义标签生成和增强，通过多注意力机制建模跨域序列推荐问题，在电商数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐系统需要准确捕捉域内和跨域行为模式，为用户提供个性化体验，但现有方法在语义理解和复杂兴趣建模方面存在局限。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与物品标识符、文本和视觉特征融合，构建增强的物品表示，并引入标签增强的多注意力机制联合建模用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法，验证了LLM语义标签和多注意力集成的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM在推动消费电子领域智能、以用户为中心服务方面的潜力，为跨域推荐系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion

further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart

Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病早期准确诊断面临挑战，需要低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出HMVDx框架，使用两个MLLM分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑的可用性指标。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLM在医疗应用中的潜力，为未来MLLM在医疗视频理解领域的研究提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 尽管大型视觉语言模型(VLMs)在通用任务中表现出色，但在图像隐私预测任务中，专门的轻量级模型仍优于这些资源密集型VLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究趋势偏向使用通用的大型视觉语言模型，但缺乏系统评估来比较这些模型与专用模型在图像隐私预测方面的性能上限。

Method: 建立了零样本图像隐私分类基准，评估了排名前三的开源VLMs，使用任务对齐提示，并与已有的视觉专用和多模态方法进行对比。

Result: VLMs在隐私预测准确性上落后于专门的轻量级模型，尽管VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 资源密集型的VLMs目前在图像隐私预测任务中尚未超越专门的轻量级模型，但具有更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Conclusion: DSE能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，通过量化语义不一致性显著提高诊断答案准确性，为临床VLM应用提供了有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法依赖手工启发式或外部关键帧模型，前者忽略时序线索，后者增加系统复杂度，需要统一框架同时处理时序定位和视频分割。

Method: 提出统一框架联合优化TSG和RefVOS，使用FIND令牌进行关键时刻识别，设计时刻中心采样策略和双向锚点更新传播机制。

Result: 框架自然融入关键时刻定位能力，避免外部时间戳编码，通过密集采样信息时刻和稀疏采样非关键帧来保持运动细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有采样策略的局限性，提供了一种更高效统一的视频目标分割解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Motivation: 现有的大多数多模态推理方法在RLVR优化过程中忽视了视觉感知的关键作用，本文从token感知这一新颖视角探索多模态RLVR，旨在更有效地提升模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出VPPO算法，通过双重机制：基于整体视觉依赖度重新加权轨迹优势，并仅对感知关键token进行策略更新。该方法基于对CoT过程的细粒度分析，发现token感知在轨迹中稀疏分布且不同轨迹间视觉依赖度差异显著。

Result: 在8个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得了显著提升，其有效性在7B和32B模型规模上得到一致验证。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅为分析多模态RLVR建立了新的token级感知视角，还提出了一种新颖有效的优化策略，能够显著增强LVLMs的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建CapGeo-Bench基准数据集进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁文本描述，将视觉内容转换为文本描述是提升几何推理的有效途径。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过几何图形描述辅助推理，将视觉和文本模态连接起来。同时提出CapGeo-Bench数据集，包含4641个精心筛选的图形-描述对，并采用基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 使用描述辅助后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升至59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升至73.0%。提出的评估指标与下游CapGeo性能强相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径，证明文本描述是提升几何推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来改进自监督单目深度估计，解决了语义-空间知识提取不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而存在性能限制，需要更好的上下文信息获取方式。

Method: 采用从粗到精的渐进学习框架：1) 聚合CLIP的全局语义和DINO的局部空间细节特征，通过对比语言指导设计代理任务；2) 集成相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中显著优于所有最先进方法，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP语义上下文和DINO空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，提升了深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Motivation: 病理图像中的细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺限制了全监督方法的应用，现有半监督方法在实例级一致性正则化、病理结构先验知识利用和伪标签噪声控制方面存在不足。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识引导的伪标签质量控制，有效提升了半监督细胞核实例分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的PPFN方法在热红外图像增强任务中表现出色，特别是在处理复合退化问题时效果显著，并建立了高质量的多场景红外基准数据集。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的视觉语言模型结合动态CoT策略能够有效解决多模态关键词预测中的挑战，特别是在处理缺失和未见场景方面表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，往往将视觉输入视为可替换的背景。为了填补这一空白，需要开发专注于视觉内容推理的基准。

Result: 评估了20个领先的MLLM，包括12个基础模型和8个推理增强模型。BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成重大挑战，现有语言空间的推理策略（如思维链或自我批评）虽然能提高性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。

Conclusion: 重复图像观察能提高模型性能，而像o3模型展示的主动视觉交互突显了视觉推理需要新范式的必要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Conclusion: VAD-GS能够有效解决3D高斯泼溅在城市场景中的几何恢复问题，即使在缺乏初始点的区域也能基于可靠几何先验生成新的高斯基元。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清单技术。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，使得无需完全重新训练即可高效部署预训练的视觉transformer模型。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor提供了一个灵活准确的4D场景文本驱动编辑框架，成功解决了复杂动态场景中局部语义编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 基于学习的方法在真实低光场景中仍难以处理严重噪声，主要原因是无法有效利用时间信息。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用视觉状态空间块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入基于动态权重的时间聚合循环细化模块，通过光流引导自适应平衡静态和动态区域。

Result: 在真实低光视频上的实验表明，DWTA-Net能有效抑制噪声和伪影，相比最先进方法提供更优的视觉质量。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索，成功解决了低光视频增强中的噪声问题，实现了卓越的增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了SilvaScenes数据集，用于从树冠下图像进行树种实例分割，包含1476棵24种树木的标注，展示了树种分类的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 林业管理中的机器人技术需要先进的感知能力，但现有数据集不足以开发此类系统，因为它们通常关注城市环境或物种数量有限。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克的五个生物气候区域收集数据，创建了包含1476棵24种树木标注的SilvaScenes数据集，并基准测试了现代深度学习实例分割方法。

Result: 树木分割相对容易，最高mAP达到67.65%，但树种分类仍然是一个重大挑战，mAP仅为35.69%。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了林业感知数据集的空白，为开发复杂自然环境中树木检测和细粒度物种分类系统提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at
https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/SilvaScenes.

Motivation: 测试时自适应方法在处理未标记目标数据时具有灵活性，但对比视觉语言模型存在由单一主导特征维度引起的模态差距问题，影响校准性能

Method: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布使其趋向均匀分布，减少主导维度的依赖性

Result: 该方法缓解了测试时提示调优中校准性能的退化，提高了视觉语言模型在实际部署场景中的可靠性

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化是一种简单有效的解决方案，能够增强视觉语言模型在现实世界部署中的可靠性

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于DreamBooth的改进方法，通过多令牌策略和LoRA高效微调，实现从少量参考角色生成无限数量新角色，同时保持艺术风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动画和游戏行业需要从少量人类设计角色生成大量新角色，同时保持艺术风格和视觉特征的挑战。

Method: 基于DreamBooth微调文本到图像扩散模型，采用多令牌策略（为单个角色和集体风格分配独立令牌），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机令牌和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上的评估显示，该方法能生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征，人类评估进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从少量参考角色无限生成新角色的目标，在保持艺术风格一致性的同时拓展了创意可能性，在动画和游戏领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Method: 提出了临床基础的方法来定义评估任务和指标，并构建了软件框架用于构建标准化评估流程。

Result: 评估发现：最小化用户交互处理中的信息损失对模型稳健性至关重要；自适应缩放机制提升稳健性和收敛速度；验证提示行为/预算与训练不同时性能下降；2D方法在平板状图像和粗粒度目标上表现良好，但3D上下文有助于处理大或不规则形状目标；非医学领域模型在对比度差和复杂形状时性能下降。

Conclusion: 需要标准化评估方法以确保交互式分割算法的公平比较和真实世界性能评估，强调了临床相关评估的重要性。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代MLLMs在具身AI中利用常识知识进行高级规划，但对其物理工具理解能力的真实程度尚未量化评估。

Method: 构建包含1000+图像-文本对的VQA数据集，评估32个MLLMs在三个难度级别上的表现：工具识别、工具理解和工具创造。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，特别是在工具原理理解和创造性工具制作方面。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的模型来提升对物理工具的理解能力，该基准为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影及其对PRNU相机源验证的影响，因为某些Galaxy系列机型存在导致指纹碰撞的共同模式。

Method: 分析多个三星智能手机型号的图像，比较普通模式和PRO模式RAW图像的差异，研究伪影在HDR和肖像模式图像中的表现。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S和A系列机型存在共同伪影模式；支持RAW拍摄的设备可避免伪影影响；伪影可用于减少HDR误检和定位肖像模式合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影会影响PRNU验证，但RAW图像可规避此问题；这些伪影在法证分析中具有实用价值，可用于图像处理检测和区域定位。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小目标表示，在计算约束下实现了优越的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航空图像中小目标检测在特征提取过程中由于有限像素表示导致的信息退化问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节常偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含两个模块：渐进细化颈部（PRN）通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐；增强切片采样（ESSamp）通过优化重排和卷积在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比计算约束下优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和利用原始浅层空间特征，有效提升了小目标检测性能，实现了更好的准确率-效率平衡。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Motivation: 传统多层感知机作为隐式神经表示进行变形建模时，需要昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且特征对齐效果不佳。

Method: 将变形重构为微分向量流的构建，在网络架构中直接编码结构流属性，确保变换的连续性和可逆性。

Result: 在面部变形、图像变形和高斯泼溅变形等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，并具有更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FLOWING提供了一种原则性且稳定的变换方法，能够准确且结构保持地进行2D图像和3D形状的变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA是一种新的可控扩散模型范式，通过超网络动态生成LoRA适配器，在扩散过程的每个步骤中根据时间和用户条件定制权重修改，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入新模态的指导，这种静态条件策略限制了模型在从粗结构到精细细节的生成过程中适应响应能力。

Method: 使用超网络动态生成LoRA适配器，在冻结骨干网络的每个扩散步骤中基于时间和用户条件定制权重修改，实现参数化控制。

Result: 在各种数据域上的实验表明，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循度。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种替代方法，通过更深层次的权重功能适应来修改模型的条件策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求对齐。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

TL;DR: FSP-DETR是一个统一的检测框架，能够在单一模型中实现鲁棒的少样本检测、开放集识别以及向未见过的生物医学任务的泛化，特别适用于标记数据稀缺和新兴类别频繁出现的生物医学场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域的目标检测面临标记数据稀缺和频繁出现新类别或罕见类别的根本性约束，需要能够处理少样本学习、开放集识别和跨任务泛化的统一解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，从原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级Transformer解码器学习嵌入空间。训练过程联合优化原型匹配损失、基于对齐的分离损失和KL散度正则化，以在稀缺监督下改善判别性特征学习和校准。

Result: 在卵形寄生虫、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR显著优于先前的少样本和基于原型的检测器，特别是在低样本和开放集场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的框架，能够在推理时灵活支持未见类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应而无需重新训练，为生物医学目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个专为实时理解无限视频流设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练推理框架和紧凑的KV缓存机制，解决了长视频处理中的计算成本和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临二次计算成本和延迟问题，简单的滑动窗口方法会破坏连贯性或导致冗余计算。

Method: 采用统一的训练推理框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存（注意力汇、近期视觉token和文本token），通过监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM对GPT-4O mini的胜率达到66.18%，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持8 FPS的稳定实时性能，同时在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功实现了对无限视频流的实时稳定理解，其SFT策略不仅提升了流式处理能力，还增强了通用VQA能力，无需专门的VQA微调。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioASQ数据集上的表现，引入基于词典的后处理策略解决实体分类错误，在开发集上F1分数从0.79提升到0.83，但在盲测集上效果未泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学命名实体识别中相似实体类型（如基因和化学品）难以区分的问题，提升模型性能。

Method: 使用GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入基于词典的后处理策略来修正常见错误分类。

Result: 在开发集上F1分数从0.79提升到0.83，但在盲测集上后处理模型F1为0.77，低于基线的0.79。

Conclusion: 基于词典的优化方法对预训练BioNER模型有潜力，但面临开发数据过拟合的挑战，需要确保模型在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) 在候选多样性受限时会产生安全漏洞，RefDiv攻击方法揭示了这一未被认识的失效模式，现有安全防护措施对此防护有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示TTS方法中候选多样性假设的潜在安全风险，当多样性受限时TTS更容易产生不安全输出，这一失效模式之前未被充分认识。

Method: 提出RefDiv（参考引导多样性减少）协议作为诊断攻击方法，通过约束候选池多样性来压力测试TTS流水线，在多个开源和闭源模型及TTS策略上进行实验验证。

Result: 多样性受限显著增加TTS产生不安全输出的概率，效果甚至超过高对抗性意图的提示词；现有安全防护分类器无法检测RefDiv生成的对抗性输入提示。

Conclusion: TTS存在基于多样性的通用失效模式，需要设计既能保持有效性又能抵御多样性针对性攻击的鲁棒TTS策略。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HAREN-CTC架构，通过多任务学习和跨层注意力整合多层级SSL特征，结合CTC损失处理稀疏时间监督，在语音抑郁检测任务上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音抑郁检测方法通常只使用SSL模型的最终层或寻找单一最佳层，容易过拟合且无法充分利用层次结构来检测细微的抑郁信号。

Method: HAREN-CTC包含两个关键模块：层次自适应聚类模块重组SSL特征为互补嵌入，跨模态融合模块通过跨注意力建模层间依赖关系，结合CTC损失进行对齐感知训练。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上达到0.81的宏F1分数，在MODMA数据集上达到0.82的宏F1分数，在两个评估场景中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC通过有效整合多层级SSL特征和CTC对齐训练，显著提升了语音抑郁检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

Motivation: 解决人工智能中机器学习模型对数学理解程度的核心问题，超越传统基准测试来诊断具体失败点。

Method: 首先让GPT-3.5-turbo在GSM8K数据集上生成结构化分步推理，然后用更强大的GPT-4o-mini模型进行错误分类和无监督聚类，识别出现的"推理模式"。

Result: 揭示了模型认知特征的非人类脆弱性：在顺序计算等程序性模式上近乎完美，但在需要限制条件下的组合推理模式上性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 通过识别和量化不同推理技能的可靠性，为评估数学理解提供了更细粒度的方法，并为开发新能力和更可靠的未来应用提供了精确路线图。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一个受人类记忆启发的无监督长期记忆架构，专为边缘设备上的LLM设计，使用图结构存储和概率回忆机制，在医疗对话场景中显著优于传统RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM内存系统在边缘设备上的局限性，传统方法要么依赖暴力扩展上下文，要么使用静态检索管道，无法处理边缘约束设备上的长期记忆需求。

Method: 采用图结构存储、模块化过滤机制、记忆提交和修剪机制，以及基于人类记忆建模的概率回忆（包含时间衰减和刷新过程），并引入核心摘要来捕获用户个性特征。

Result: 在纵向医疗对话实验中，Mnemosyne在盲测人类评估中获得65.8%的胜率（基准RAG为31.1%），在LoCoMo基准测试中取得当前最高的时间推理和单跳检索分数，总体得分54.6%排名第二。

Conclusion: Mnemosyne证明了通过边缘兼容且易于迁移的无监督记忆架构，可以实现改进的事实回忆、增强的时间推理和更自然的用户响应。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

TL;DR: 提出Confidence Score(CS)作为无参考指标，缓解传统基于流畅度指标对创意文本生成的偏见，实验证明CS在创意提示下更偏好新颖回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无参考指标如self-perplexity对创意文本生成存在强烈偏见，需要开发更公平的评估方法。

Method: 从模型输出概率分布推导出Confidence Score(CS)，在gpt-4o-mini上进行实验，比较CS与传统流畅度指标在99个创意提示下的表现。

Result: 流畅度指标在创意提示下偏好新颖回答的比例为0%，而CS为19%，差异显著(95% CI: [11.1%, 27.3%])。CS还能有效区分不同难度任务。

Conclusion: Confidence Score减轻了传统指标对创意的偏见，同时保留了核心评估优势，为现代LLM提供了更平衡的评估方法。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化（如量化、剪枝、格式转换等）会导致语言模型性能下降，现有研究主要关注量化恢复，而本文关注从任何导致模型权重退化的来源中恢复模型准确性。

Method: 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏，在选择性层上学习LoRA适配器，将退化模型与其全精度模型对齐。

Result: 在多种小型语言模型（包括MHA和GQA注意力架构）上，Recover-LoRA能够恢复模型准确性5-17%。

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA是一种有效的模型准确性恢复方法，适用于各种注意力架构的小型语言模型。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域如病理学中仍会产生幻觉，现有方法依赖领域微调但无法扩展知识边界或实施证据约束

Method: 构建包含28个子领域、153万段落的病理学向量数据库，采用双通道混合检索（BGE-M3密集检索+词汇引导稀疏检索）和基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块

Result: 在YpathR基准上Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提升23个百分点；在YpathQA-M上，通用和医疗LLM准确率平均提升9.0%，最高提升15.6%

Conclusion: YpathRAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估方法，显著改善了病理学导向RAG的检索质量和事实可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction

Motivation: 现有越狱攻击通过添加高困惑度对抗后缀或长模板来解锁模型响应，但容易被基于困惑度的过滤检测到。需要开发能规避此类防御的新方法。

Method: 通过最小化对抗提示与无害请求在潜在空间中表示的距离，选择语义等效词替换输入提示中的词汇，保持提示意图不变。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效生成自然、低困惑度的对抗提示，成功规避基于困惑度的防御机制，在越狱攻击中表现优异。

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length
inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into
multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual,
multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation
that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work
underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in
safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing
the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于情感热点的对话情感识别方法，通过检测文本、音频和视频中的情感热点，使用热点门控融合和路由混合对齐器来整合多模态信息，在标准基准测试中取得了优于基线模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话情感识别面临的主要挑战是判别性证据稀疏、局部化且跨模态异步。为了解决这些问题，研究聚焦于情感热点，旨在更有效地捕捉多模态中的关键情感信息。

Method: 提出统一模型：检测每句话在文本、音频和视频中的情感热点；通过热点门控融合将热点与全局特征结合；使用路由混合对齐器进行模态对齐；构建跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准ERC基准测试中，该方法相比强基线模型取得了持续的性能提升，消融实验证实了热点门控融合和混合对齐器的贡献。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明热点中心视角可以为未来多模态学习提供信息，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: MMA-ASIA是一个评估LLMs在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识框架，包含多语言多模态对齐的基准数据集和五维评估协议，旨在提升模型在非西方环境中的文化可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在西方高资源环境外的多模态理解和推理能力下降，需要专门评估其在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识。

Method: 构建包含27,000个问题的多语言多模态基准数据集，覆盖8个亚洲国家和10种语言；提出五维评估协议和Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module检测捷径学习；使用Vision-ablated Prefix Replay等方法分析模型差异。

Result: 创建了首个在文本、图像和语音三个模态输入层面对齐的数据集，79%以上问题需要基于文化背景的多步推理。

Conclusion: MMA-ASIA框架为构建文化可靠的多模态LLMs提供了可操作的见解，揭示了模型在不同语言和模态间的差异原因。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出卓越的推理能力，但其背后的结构机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用图表示神经元激活和信号传播，应用PageRank等图算法分析LLMs特性，并通过结构干预评估关键神经元节点。

Result: 揭示了跨不同数据集的共享和模型特定的推理行为，显示对关键神经元节点的编辑会引发推理崩溃，改变逻辑流程和语义理解。

Conclusion: GraphGhost是分析、干预和最终理解LLMs推理结构基础的强大工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

*Kaiqi Yang,Hang Li,Yucheng Chu,Zitao Liu,Mi Tian,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个利用LLM自动生成数学应用题干扰条件的迭代框架，保持原问题解不变，减少人工标注成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学应用题数据集大多只包含必要信息，而包含干扰条件的数据集有限且质量不高，导致LLM在干扰条件下的性能评估不可靠

Method: 设计迭代框架，使用LLM从多角度和认知层面修订数学应用题，生成有意义的干扰条件，同时保持原问题解不变

Result: 框架高效易部署，显著减少了生成含干扰条件数学应用题的工作量，同时保持高质量数据

Conclusion: 该框架为评估LLM在复杂数学推理场景下的能力提供了可靠的数据生成方法

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过重新评估模型在基准问题改写版本上的表现来探测LLM泛化能力的简单协议，发现改写会导致准确率显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的基准分数可能因记忆测试项或近似重复项而被夸大，需要探测其真实泛化能力。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在ARC-Easy和ARC-Challenge数据集上测量原始项与改写项之间的准确率差距，包含解码控制、多选题输出格式强制和改写清理步骤。

Result: 改写会导致显著的准确率下降（原始vs改写），与之前关于污染和脆弱表面形式捷径的担忧一致。

Conclusion: 基准测试中的改写评估揭示了LLM对表面形式的依赖，表明现有基准分数可能高估了模型的真实泛化能力。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个750亿参数的泰语中心化语言模型，采用上扩增策略从高性能英语模型扩展参数空间，系统集成泰语知识，在泰语基准测试中表现优于Typhoon2-70B。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泰语模型主要依赖开源模型进行额外训练，但这种方法可能侵蚀模型原有的通用知识。需要一种既能保留通用智能又能有效集成泰语知识的方法。

Method: 从较小的英语开源LLM开始，扩展其参数空间，利用新增容量系统集成泰语知识。预训练接触1.5万亿token（含3000亿泰语token），随后进行监督微调和对齐调优。

Result: 在泰语中心化基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）中表现优于Typhoon2-70B，验证了上扩增和知识集成框架的有效性。

Conclusion: JAI-1的上扩增策略成功保留了原始模型的通用智能，同时建立了独特的架构，为未来可扩展增强奠定了基础。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话代理模型的快速发展，需要真实的用户模拟器研究来优化有效的对话策略，特别是在销售导向的对话系统中。

Method: 引入轻量级的职业条件策略，使代理能够根据用户职业偏好优先选择相关对话意图，基于年龄、性别和职业的用户画像进行分析。

Result: 年龄和性别影响整体性能，但职业在对话意图上产生最显著差异，采用职业条件策略后实现了更短且更成功的对话。

Conclusion: 丰富的模拟器用户画像很重要，简单的基于人物特征的策略可以显著提升销售导向对话系统的有效性。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Text2Stories任务和指标，用于量化需求（用户故事）与访谈记录中表达的实际需求之间的对齐程度，包括正确性和完整性两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型可以自动从自然语言输入生成软件需求，但评估这些需求是否真实反映利益相关者需求仍然主要依赖人工任务。

Method: 将访谈记录分割成文本块，将对齐问题实例化为文本块与用户故事之间的匹配问题，使用基于LLM的匹配器进行实验。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验显示，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到0.86的宏F1分数，而仅使用嵌入模型效果较差但可实现有效阻塞。

Conclusion: Text2Stories指标能够比较不同故事集（如人工生成vs自动生成），作为现有用户故事质量标准的可扩展、忠实于来源的补充。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARSE系统通过自动优化JSON模式和改进提取方法，显著提升了从非结构化文本中提取结构化信息的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将JSON模式视为静态合约，导致提取性能不佳、幻觉频发和代理行为不可靠，特别是在模式包含模糊或不完整规范时。

Method: 开发PARSE系统，包含ARCHITECT（自动优化JSON模式）和SCOPE（基于反射的提取方法），结合静态和LLM防护机制。

Result: 在三个数据集上评估，SWDE提取准确率提升64.7%，综合框架改进达10%，首次重试减少92%提取错误，保持实用延迟。

Conclusion: PARSE通过将JSON模式视为可解释和优化的自然语言理解合约，显著改善了结构化信息提取的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现评估导向的提示框架会人为夸大LLM性能，导致推理链过长、答案合规性下降，而准确率提升有限或不一致，建议采用中性措辞和双框架检查来确保基准测试反映真实部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试常使用评估导向的提示框架，而实际部署需要简洁、契约约束的答案，研究旨在验证这种"评估气味"是否夸大了测量性能而未能带来相应的能力提升。

Method: 使用单一开源模型(GPT-OSS-20B)，在六个配对A/B场景中保持任务内容和解码固定，仅改变框架(评估导向vs真实世界)和推理深度，通过确定性验证器计算准确率、答案合规性等指标。

Result: 评估框架显著增加了推理链长度(数百到1000+字符)，降低了答案合规性，准确率提升有限或不一致；激励措辞会重新加权错误构成；多语言标题会重现这些特征。

Conclusion: 需要采用中性措辞、双框架检查、契约感知评分等方法来确保基准测试收益反映可部署能力，提供了可复现的A/B框架和实用指南。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理能力强但推理成本高，小型语言模型效率高但推理能力未被充分探索。现有系统未能充分利用自然语言推理文本作为学习信号的潜力。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，将SLM生成的推理文本视为直接学习信号，与交互历史共同监督，联合建模用户行为及其语义驱动因素，创建跨领域的Thought Space。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PULSE超越了领先的ID、协同过滤和LLM序列推荐模型，在跨领域推荐中表现出优越的迁移能力，并在推理问答等下游任务中表现强劲。

Conclusion: PULSE通过将推理文本作为一等学习信号，产生了更鲁棒和可泛化的嵌入表示，为高效且有效的推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有的仇恨表情包检测方法多为直接检测，只能提供二元预测，缺乏上下文和解释，无法满足实际内容审核需求。而现有的解释-检测方法性能不佳，甚至不如简单的监督微调基线。

Method: 提出ExPO-HM方法，受人类标注者训练和评估过程启发，结合监督微调预热、GRPO与课程学习，并使用条件决策熵作为推理质量的度量和奖励。

Result: 在三个仇恨表情包基准测试中，ExPO-HM在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面都达到了最先进的性能，相比GRPO和DPO基线F1分数分别提升15%和17%。

Conclusion: ExPO-HM将仇恨表情包检测从简单的二元警报转变为解释驱动的检测，提供了准确、可解释且可操作的内容审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型在语义层次建模方面存在局限，需要一种能够处理不同语义粒度的通用框架。

Method: 构建分层词汇表，前向过程将token扰动到更高层次的抽象语义，反向过程逐步预测更详细的语义，实现时间变化的语义尺度预测。

Conclusion: HDLM提供了一个通用的语义层次扩散建模框架，能够有效提升语言建模性能，且包含现有MDLM作为特例。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

Method: 采用小模型（压缩器）和大模型（执行器）的协作工作流：第一阶段训练压缩器生成富含推理信息的前期思想嵌入；第二阶段优化执行器利用这些嵌入进行短推理并获得正确答案。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，UCoT将Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的token使用量减少50%，性能比SOTA方法提高3.08%。

Conclusion: UCoT框架有效实现了CoT压缩自动化，在保持推理能力的同时显著提升效率，为LLM高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

### [120] [Formalizing Style in Personal Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08649)
*Gustave Cortal,Alain Finkel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析个人叙事风格的正式框架，通过整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取语言特征，并在梦境叙事中验证了该框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人叙事是作者构建意义的重要方式，风格是表达主观体验的关键，但目前缺乏系统分析这些风格选择的正式框架。

Method: 整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取过程、参与者和环境等语言特征，分析序列模式。

Result: 在数百个梦境叙事中应用该框架，包括对患有创伤后应激障碍的战争退伍军人的案例研究，发现其叙事中言语过程主导心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 该框架成功揭示了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系，为系统分析个人叙事风格提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

TL;DR: 本研究利用LLM技术将定性文本数据与传统评分量表相结合，创建增强型心理测试，在抑郁症评估中显著提高了测量精度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估依赖结构化评分量表，无法充分利用受访者自然语言的丰富信息，需要开发新方法来整合定性数据。

Method: 结合LLM评分的文本数据和传统评分量表项目，创建增强测试，基于项目信息计算经验性地选择最具信息量的LLM评分指令。

Result: 增强测试在测量精度和准确性方面获得统计显著提升，LLM项目的信息增益相当于为原始19项测试增加6.3-16.0个项目。

Conclusion: 该框架为利用转录文本增强传统心理测量提供了可扩展方法，在临床健康等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个高效可扩展的扩散式大语言模型推理框架，通过模块化设计和系统优化，在保持输出质量的同时实现了显著的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLMs)作为自回归模型的替代方案具有并行生成优势，但由于缺乏标准化高效的推理框架而限制了广泛应用。

Method: 将推理流程分解为四个模块化组件：模型、扩散迭代管理器、解码策略和KV缓存管理器，并为每个组件集成新算法和系统级优化。

Result: 在8×H800 GPU上，HumanEval达到1100+ tokens/秒，六个基准测试平均800+ tokens/秒；相比Fast-dLLM实现10倍加速，相比优化后的自回归模型QWen2.5-3B仍有2-3倍加速。

Conclusion: dInfer通过算法创新和系统优化的结合，显著提升了dLLM的推理效率，为扩散式语言模型的广泛应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次对代码LLM的缩放规律进行大规模实证研究，发现代码比自然语言需要更高的数据-参数比，且在不同计算预算下自然语言数据的混合效果不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放规律主要基于自然语言分析，但代码与自然语言存在严格语法等根本差异，需要验证这些规律是否适用于代码LLM。

Method: 进行了117次实验运行，模型规模从0.2B到3.8B，训练token从2B到128B，拟合了Chinchilla和Farsser定律。

Result: 1) Farsser定律更准确；2) 代码LLM能有效随模型规模扩展；3) 代码需要比自然语言高得多的数据-参数比；4) 在资源受限时自然语言数据有益，但在高计算预算时反而有害。

Conclusion: 代码LLM的缩放规律与自然语言不同，需要专门针对代码特性的缩放策略，特别是在数据需求和混合训练方面。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个三阶段推理框架来分析LLM在法律案例推理中的能力，发现在表面推理任务上表现良好，但在层次推理和综合分析任务上性能显著下降，且模型在错误回答上消耗更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 案例推理是美国法律实践的核心，需要专业人士通过类比和区分先例来论证当前案件。虽然LLM展现出强大能力，但它们在复杂、细致的法律推理方面的熟练度仍需进一步研究。

Method: 提出了一个正式框架，将识别案例间重要区别的过程分解为三阶段推理任务：使用事实谓词（因素）建模案例，将其组织到法律知识层次结构中，并定义可验证的规则来识别区别、分析其论证支持并评估其重要性。

Result: 评估显示现代推理LLM存在悖论：模型在表面推理（任务1）上达到高准确率，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）上性能下降，在综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）上表现崩溃。最显著的是，模型在错误回答上比正确回答消耗更多计算资源。

Conclusion: 本研究为复杂领域中LLM推理能力的细粒度分析提供了方法学，揭示了必须解决的基本限制，以实现稳健可信的法律AI。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在计算成本高、分数膨胀和偏向简单错误的问题，需要找到最小错误代码集和测试用例集来充分覆盖错误空间。

Method: 将基准构建形式化为在二元代码-测试矩阵中寻找最优诊断基础，提出WrongSelect算法选择最大多样性的错误代码，构建TC-Bench基准。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的测试用例生成方法在TC-Bench上也只能达到约60%的排除率，暴露了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建紧凑且有效的基准测试，揭示了当前测试用例生成方法的局限性，为改进LLM测试生成提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 微基准测试在语言模型评估中的可靠性有限，需要250个样本才能稳定排名相似性能的模型，现有方法在小型微基准上无法保持一致的模型排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微基准测试能否像完整基准测试一样一致地排名模型，以及是否比随机选择数据点更可靠。

Method: 引入元评估方法，分析微基准在不同性能差异下排名模型的能力，比较不同微基准大小和方法的可靠性。

Result: 发现现有微基准方法无法在MMLU-Pro上稳定排名3.5分精度差异的模型对，或在BIG-bench Hard上排名4分差异的模型对；需要250个样本才能可靠排名相似性能模型。

Conclusion: 微基准测试在效率和可靠性之间存在权衡，需要更多样本才能保证排名一致性，随机采样在较大样本量时与现有方法相当。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Motivation: 地理编码是将位置引用链接到实际地理位置的任务，对非结构化文本的下游分析至关重要。本文探索组合位置引用地理编码这一具有挑战性的场景。

Method: 基于LLM对地理空间数据的推理能力评估，提出了一种LLM驱动的组合位置引用地理编码策略，包括对相对较小的LLM进行微调。

Result: 该方法提高了地理编码任务的性能，小型微调LLM能够达到与大型现成模型相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: LLM在地理编码任务中表现出色，特别是经过适当微调的小型模型可以在保持性能的同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Motivation: 随着LLM在全球多语言环境中的广泛应用，需要理解和保障其多语言响应的质量，特别是在不同资源语言中的表现。

Method: 使用五点评分标准和法官LLM，评估模型在低资源和高资源语言中五个维度的响应。

Result: GPT-5在所有类别中平均表现最佳，特别是在同意与自主权（3.56）和伤害预防与安全（4.73）类别中得分最高；Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最差（分别为1.39和1.98）。

Conclusion: 需要进一步测试语言变化如何影响LLM在不同类别中的响应，并改进这些领域的表现。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Retention方法，通过概率性、分层token选择机制，在严格全局预算M下学习保留哪些表示，解决Transformer注意力二次方复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制随序列长度呈二次方增长(O(n²))，限制了长上下文的使用。

Method: 使用Bernoulli门通过Hard-Concrete/变分松弛进行训练，在推理时通过简单的top-M规则强制执行，使方法可微分且可直接替换标准编码器。

Result: 在分类、抽取式QA和长文档摘要任务中，仅保留30-50%的token即可保持≥95%的完整模型性能，同时将峰值内存减少约35-45%，吞吐量提高约1.8倍。

Conclusion: 这种架构无关的方法在不修改基础注意力或任务头的情况下，实现了实用的长上下文效率。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型展现出先进的推理能力，但在通用中文语境下的全面评估仍然不足，需要专门的中文常识多跳推理基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 首先从现有QA数据集中构建领域平衡的种子集，然后开发基于LLM的流水线生成基于事实单元链的多跳问题，并通过专家参与的人工验证系统确保数据质量。

Result: 评估显示最先进的LLM在处理长尾知识和执行知识密集型推理方面存在持续局限，但检索增强生成显著缓解了这些知识差距，带来明显的性能提升。

Conclusion: CCMOR基准揭示了LLM在中文多跳推理中的知识处理局限，同时证明了检索增强生成在弥补这些局限方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

Motivation: 科学编程任务需要严谨的算法、深度领域知识和特定推理，传统方法难以处理需要解决一系列子问题的复杂科学任务。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含专门设计的智能体进行自我反思、创建推理、编码和调试，使用学生-教师范式，结合统一上下文窗口(CCW)减少幻觉。

Result: 在科学编程基准测试中，MOSAIC在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSAIC框架能有效解决复杂的科学编程任务，通过智能体协作和上下文管理显著提升性能。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多语言应用中处理敏感数据时存在隐私风险，但现有研究主要针对英语，需要了解语言结构如何影响隐私泄露。

Method: 量化六个语言指标，评估三种攻击向量：提取攻击、反事实记忆和成员推断，在英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语医学语料库上测试。

Result: 隐私漏洞与语言冗余和分词粒度相关：意大利语泄露最强，英语成员推断可分离性最高，法语和西班牙语因形态复杂性更具韧性。

Conclusion: 语言结构确实影响隐私泄露，需要开发语言感知的隐私保护机制来应对LLMs部署中的隐私风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

Method: SoG框架使用单一的Search函数，让LLM遵循"观察-然后导航"原则，在每一步检查当前实体的实际可用关系后再决定下一跳，无需预规划路径或检索大子图。

Result: 在六个KGQA基准测试中（涵盖Freebase和Wikidata），SoG无需微调即达到最先进性能，特别是在Wikidata基准上比之前最佳方法提升16%，在Freebase基准上也表现一致提升。

Conclusion: SoG通过简单的迭代图导航方法有效解决了KGQA中的关键挑战，展示了在知识图谱问答任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

*Ragib Amin Nihal,Rui Wen,Kazuhiro Nakadai,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PE-CoA框架，通过五种对话模式构建有效的多轮越狱攻击，在12个LLM上评估显示达到最先进性能，揭示了模式特定的漏洞和LLM行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱方法依赖启发式或临时探索策略，对模型底层弱点提供有限洞察，对话模式与跨危害类别的模型漏洞关系理解不足。

Method: 提出Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA)框架，包含五种对话模式，通过自然对话构建多轮越狱。

Result: 在12个LLM和10个危害类别上评估，达到最先进性能，发现模型表现出不同的弱点分布，对一种对话模式的鲁棒性不能推广到其他模式，模型家族共享相似的失败模式。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了安全训练的局限性，表明需要模式感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

*Krzysztof Mrozinski,Minji Kang,Ahmed Khota,Vincent Michael Sutanto,Giovanni Gatti De Giacomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了文档级质量估计重排序在机器翻译中的应用，发现使用SLIDE和GEMBA-DA等质量评估指标，在文档级翻译中能显著提升翻译质量，特别是在使用更多候选翻译时效果更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量估计重排序在句子级机器翻译中已被证明有效，但在日益重要的文档级翻译领域应用不足，需要探索其在文档级翻译中的表现。

Method: 使用多种学习型和基于大语言模型的质量评估指标（如SLIDE和GEMBA-DA），在文档级翻译中对生成的候选翻译进行评分和选择，评估重排序效果。

Result: 使用最佳学习型指标SLIDE时，BLEURT-20分数在仅2个候选翻译时提升+2.00，在32个候选翻译时提升+5.09；使用最佳LLM指标GEMBA-DA时，分别提升+1.63和+4.30。即使在最长文档（512-1024源标记）上，使用32个候选翻译仍能获得+2.34（SLIDE）和+1.40（GEMBA-DA）的提升。

Conclusion: 文档级质量估计重排序具有实际应用价值，在合适的翻译模型和硬件条件下，能以最小的运行时开销显著提升文档级翻译质量。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing是首个针对财务审计任务的基准测试，评估LLMs在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力，包含三个子任务：语义一致性、关系一致性和数值一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL的分层结构使得财务审计难以自动化和验证，而LLMs在结构化财务文档推理方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 从真实的US-GAAP合规XBRL文件中构建FinAuditing基准，定义三个互补子任务，并提出统一的评估框架，整合检索、分类和推理指标。

Result: 对13个最先进LLMs的零样本实验显示，当前模型在语义、关系和数学维度上表现不一致，在分层多文档结构推理时准确率下降60-90%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现代LLMs在基于分类法的财务推理中的系统性局限，FinAuditing为开发可信赖、结构感知和法规对齐的财务智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过限制更新来间接鼓励探索，但未在token生成阶段本身明确促进探索行为。研究发现LLM中的token在推理任务中扮演不同角色，可分为高熵推理token和低熵知识token。

Method: 在采样过程中为不同类型token应用不同温度设置：对推理token使用较高温度以积极鼓励探索，对知识token使用较低温度以保持事实正确性。系统研究了多种多温度调度策略及其在强化学习环境中的影响。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过为不同类型token应用差异化温度设置来明确促进探索的方法，能够有效增强LLM的推理能力，同时保持事实准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在处理嵌套实体、实体边界模糊和跨语言泛化方面存在困难，需要开发更有效的生物医学命名实体识别方法。

Method: 将BioNER重新定义为文本生成任务，设计符号化标注策略处理平面和嵌套实体；进行中英文数据集的双语联合微调；引入基于对比学习的实体选择器过滤错误预测。

Conclusion: 提出的统一BioNER框架在生物医学命名实体识别任务上表现出色，特别是在处理嵌套实体和跨语言泛化方面具有优势。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

TL;DR: 提出语义锚压缩(SAC)方法，通过直接选择原始上下文中的锚标记并聚合信息到其KV表示中，避免了自编码训练，在多种压缩比下优于现有上下文压缩方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩方法主要依赖自编码任务训练压缩标记，但自编码优化的重建目标与下游任务存在根本不匹配，削弱了对实际使用更有益的特征。

Method: SAC直接从原始上下文选择锚标记，通过锚嵌入使压缩器识别关键标记，并采用双向注意力修改让锚标记捕获整个上下文信息，无需自编码训练。

Result: 实验表明SAC在各种压缩比下持续优于现有方法，在MRQA的分布外评估中，5倍压缩时比强基线提高1 EM，压缩比越高优势越明显。

Conclusion: SAC通过直接利用锚标记的架构设计，避免了自编码训练的不匹配问题，实现了更有效的上下文压缩。

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

Motivation: 研究LLM内部表示中是否存在类似人类印象和刻板印象的模式，以及这些模式如何影响模型的下游行为。

Method: 使用线性探针在生成的提示上预测刻板印象内容模型的两个维度，分析隐藏表示中印象的可解码性，并研究提示特征对印象的影响。

Result: 发现LLM在提示时不一致地报告印象，但印象可以从隐藏表示中更一致地线性解码；人工印象可以预测模型响应的质量和对冲使用；特定内容、风格和方言特征会影响LLM印象。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在可解码的人工印象模式，这些模式与模型行为相关，且受提示特征影响，为理解LLM中的刻板印象提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分评估LLM在涉及复杂标准操作流程(SOP)的业务场景中的能力，需要专门基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 从真实业务数据构建SOP-Maze基准，包含397个任务，分为横向根系统(LRS)和核心根系统(HRS)两类任务，分别测试广度和深度推理能力。

Result: 几乎所有最先进模型在SOP-Maze上都表现不佳，识别出三个主要错误类型：路径盲区、对话脆弱性和计算错误。

Conclusion: SOP-Maze揭示了LLM在复杂业务场景中的关键挑战，为改进模型能力提供了新见解，该基准已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on
https://github.com/ADoublLEN/SOP-Maze.

Method: 使用710个项目的配对快照语料库，将文本解析为参与者、规则、行动和对象，通过熵测量均匀性、丰富度测量多样性、Jensen Shannon散度测量漂移。

Result: 项目随时间定义更多角色和行动，且分布更均衡，而规则组成保持稳定，表明治理通过扩展和平衡参与类别而增长，没有重大规范性转变。

Conclusion: 治理通过扩展和平衡参与类别而增长，没有重大规范性转变，为评估未来AI中介工作流是否集中或重新分配权力提供了基准。

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的RLVR方法使用静态或过于简化的权重方案，无法适应模型能力的动态变化，导致训练在不同难度级别上分布不均，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出难度感知重加权策略优化(DARO)，根据模型学习状态动态调整每个难度组的损失贡献，解决损失尺度问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B、Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Llama3.1-8B模型上的实验表明，DARO在六个数学基准测试中优于四个领先基线方法，收敛速度更快且最终性能更优。

Conclusion: DARO通过动态难度感知的损失重加权机制，有效解决了现有RLVR方法的局限性，为增强语言模型的推理能力提供了更有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA-based refusal training enables performance-preserving safety alignment using only safety data, with LoRA serving as cost-efficient safety patches that decouple safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment is crucial for trustworthy AI but challenging to implement without degrading general performance. Current methods require expensive searches for optimal data proportions, incurring high costs with limited gains.

Method: Using LoRA-based refusal training that trains solely on safety data, with LoRA serving as plug-and-play safety patches that decouple safety into low-rank subspaces orthogonal to model's intrinsic capabilities.

Result: The approach enables performance-preserving safety alignment, with both theoretical and experimental evidence showing LoRA effectively isolates safety enhancements from interfering with inherent model capabilities.

Conclusion: LoRA-based refusal training provides a cost-efficient, performance-preserving solution for safety alignment, with LoRA acting as effective safety patches that maintain model general performance while enhancing safety.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

Result: 在BIRD数据集上达到72.10%的执行准确率，在Spider 1.0上达到88.45%，性能与LLM方法相当或更优，但参数数量减少2到30倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用轻量级模型实现高质量的Text-to-SQL生成是可行的，为隐私敏感和资源受限的环境提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 该研究通过迭代优化评分标准来提升LLM在自动作文评分中的表现，在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上实现了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能对提示词高度敏感，受提示优化领域启发，研究探索通过优化评分标准来提升自动作文评分效果。

Method: 让模型基于自身评分理由和与人工评分的差异，迭代优化评分标准，使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct进行实验。

Result: 在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上，QWK分别提升了0.19和0.47，即使使用简单初始评分标准，也能达到或超过详细人工编写标准的效果。

Conclusion: 迭代评分标准优化对于基于LLM的自动作文评分至关重要，能够增强与人工评估的一致性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 该研究为低资源语言查克玛语构建了孟加拉语转写的语料库，并在多个多语言Transformer模型上进行微调实验，证明了转写方法对查克玛语迁移学习的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 查克玛语作为一种印欧语系语言，可用数据有限，在语言模型中代表性不足。研究旨在通过构建高质量语料库来改善这一状况。

Method: 从查克玛文学中构建上下文连贯的孟加拉语转写查克玛语料库，经母语者验证后，在6个编码器模型（mBERT、XLM-RoBERTa等）上进行掩码语言建模微调。

Result: 微调后的多语言模型在查克玛语上表现优于预训练模型，最高达到73.54%的token准确率和2.90的困惑度。

Conclusion: 孟加拉语转写查克玛语对查克玛语的迁移学习非常有效，同时揭示了OCR管道在处理形态丰富的印度文字时的局限性。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs无法可靠地区分事实和幻觉，因为当幻觉与主题知识相关时，其内部处理过程与正确回答相同，导致无法检测；只有与主题知识无关的幻觉才具有可检测的独特表示模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真的"知道自己不知道什么"，以及内部计算是否能可靠区分事实性输出和幻觉输出。

Method: 通过机制分析比较两种类型的幻觉：基于主题知识的幻觉和与主题知识无关的幻觉，分析其内部处理过程和隐藏状态几何结构。

Result: 当幻觉与主题知识相关时，LLMs采用与正确回答相同的内部回忆过程，隐藏状态几何结构重叠且不可区分；而与主题知识无关的幻觉产生独特的聚类表示，可被检测。

Conclusion: LLMs在其内部状态中并未编码真实性，仅编码知识回忆的模式，表明"LLMs并不真正知道自己不知道什么"。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

TL;DR: 提出了Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct模型，这是一个针对乌尔都语-英语的多语言模型，通过改进的自指导技术创建高质量合成数据集，在低资源语言处理上表现出色且成本低廉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）开发高性能大语言模型面临的挑战，包括高质量数据集稀缺、多语言不一致性和安全问题。现有方法通过翻译大量数据但缺乏质量和文化细微差别。

Method: 使用改进的自指导技术创建高质量多语言合成数据集（Urdu-Instruct），包含乌尔都语本地思维链推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐。基于预训练的Llama-3.1-8B构建模型。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上表现优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并超越了包括Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B在内的领先多语言LLMs，训练成本低于100美元。

Conclusion: 通过改进的自指导方法可以高效开发高性能、低资源语言的大语言模型，并实现文化对齐。所有数据集、模型和代码均已公开。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFIne是一个训练框架，通过监督微调和GRPO结合，提升推理模型的可解释性、忠实性和可靠性，使模型生成结构化推理轨迹、披露决策信息并提供置信度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长链思维推理研究过于关注准确性和效率，忽视了可信赖性的关键方面。可用的推理系统必须具有可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReFIne训练框架，结合监督微调和GRPO，鼓励模型：生成结构化标签化轨迹提高可解释性；明确披露决策信息增强忠实性；提供自我评估提升可靠性。

Result: 在Qwen3模型(1.7B/4B/8B)上应用ReFIne，在数学基准测试中显示：推理轨迹清晰度提升44.0%，忠实性提升18.8%，可靠性提升42.4%。

Conclusion: 推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应关注可信赖性的更广泛维度。ReFIne证明了提升模型可信赖性的可行性。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于因果语言模型(CLM)的语义框架归纳新方法FrameEOL，通过提示工程获取框架嵌入，结合上下文学习和深度度量学习，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然因果语言模型(CLM)如GPT系列在多种语言理解任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于语义框架归纳任务。现有方法主要依赖掩码语言模型(MLM)，而CLM在对话中表现出对框架的理解能力，值得探索其在框架归纳中的应用。

Method: 提出FrameEOL方法：1) 使用提示工程获取输出单一框架名称的框架嵌入；2) 结合上下文学习(ICL)和深度度量学习(DML)优化嵌入质量；3) 对生成的嵌入进行聚类实现框架归纳。

Result: 在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有框架归纳方法。特别是对于缺乏丰富框架资源的日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法就达到了与使用DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: CLM在语义框架归纳任务中具有显著潜力，特别是在资源稀缺语言上，少量示例就能取得良好效果，为框架归纳研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在静态语料上训练，难以处理快速演变的信息或领域特定查询。RAG通过将LLMs与外部检索机制结合来解决这一限制，但随着LLMs本身能力的提升，传统RAG框架的相对优势变得不那么明显。

Method: 对RAG进行系统性综述，从其总体目标和核心组件开始分析，然后识别RAG中的关键挑战和限制其有效性的弱点，最后展示RAG与LLMs结合能显著提升性能的应用场景。

Result: 识别了RAG框架中的关键挑战和限制因素，展示了在LLMs单独表现不佳但RAG能显著增强其有效性的具体应用场景。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考RAG在LLMs发展背景下的作用，并鼓励研究人员开发下一代RAG系统来更好地应对当前挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

Result: 评估14个模型发现中文训练LLM优于更大规模的外国模型，DeepSeek-V3提供最忠实和风格一致的翻译。

Conclusion: 为LLM网络小说翻译研究建立了新范式，提供了公共资源推动未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

Motivation: 期望通过TAU增强的数据训练的"人格LLM"能更好地模仿说话者的人格特质，特别是基于大五人格框架。

Method: 在对话数据中添加思考话语(TAU)，即说话者在表达话语前的思维语言化，然后训练人格LLM。

Result: 使用TAU增强数据训练的LLM在宜人性和神经质这两个大五人格维度上更接近说话者的真实人格，且TAU增强的质量影响人格LLM的性能。

Conclusion: TAU增强能有效提升LLM在人格建模方面的表现，特别是在宜人性和神经质维度上，且增强质量是关键因素。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本去标识化方法难以有效评估其保护个人身份信息的能力，需要更强的重新识别攻击来测试其鲁棒性。

Method: 使用两种策略：1) 通过多个不同顺序重新识别PII跨度并聚合预测；2) 利用推理模型，特别是在攻击者拥有丰富背景知识的情况下。

Result: 这些策略显著提高了重新识别的性能，特别是在攻击者拥有广泛背景知识的情况下。

Conclusion: 所提出的重新识别攻击策略能够更有效地评估文本去标识化方法的鲁棒性，为隐私保护技术提供了更严格的测试标准。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型擅长推理但翻译能力不足，专门增强翻译的模型又缺乏推理能力，需要找到平衡两者的方法

Method: 从指令模型开始，仅使用平行数据对特定层进行选择性调优，提出了Qwen3-XPlus模型

Result: 在高低资源语言翻译上都取得显著提升，低资源语言如斯瓦希里语达到15+ spBLEU和40+ xComet，同时在7个多语言任务上平均提升1+分，在15个推理数据集上保持与Qwen3指令模型相当的能力

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言增强提供了有前景的途径，显著降低了复杂性并提高了更多语言的可访问性

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DICE是一个轻量级框架，通过小语言模型(SLMs)对大型语言模型(LLMs)的输出进行思维链修正，解决LLMs在推理任务中忽视用户特定格式要求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在执行推理任务时往往优先考虑推理质量而忽视详细的输出格式要求，而直接对LLMs进行微调成本高昂且参数访问受限。

Method: DICE采用解耦方法：先让LLMs生成自然语言响应，然后使用训练好的SLMs进行分析和精炼，确保输出符合结构化规范。通过两阶段方法构建结构化思维链适应数据集，并应用双重调优策略来微调SLMs。

Result: 实验表明，DICE将LLM输出的格式准确性和内容正确性分别提高了35.4%和29.4%，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DICE框架在保留LLMs广泛知识和推理能力的同时，确保输出符合用户需求，提供了一种高效解决LLMs格式遵从问题的方案。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Motivation: 传统统计方法面临数据收集昂贵、已知关系重复计算和不现实假设等挑战，而现有LLM方法只能识别已知关系但无法发现新关系。

Method: IRIS框架从初始变量开始，自动收集相关文档、提取变量并发现因果关系。采用混合方法结合统计算法和LLM方法，包含缺失变量提议组件来识别和纳入缺失变量。

Result: 该方法能够实现实时因果发现，仅需初始变量集而无需预存数据集。

Conclusion: IRIS框架解决了传统方法和现有LLM方法的局限性，能够有效发现已知和新的因果关系，并扩展因果图。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了CrisiText数据集，这是首个用于在13种危机场景下生成警告消息的大规模数据集，包含超过40万条警告消息，旨在帮助平民在危机期间和之后获得及时援助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在危机情况下有效识别威胁并减轻潜在损害对于保护受威胁个体至关重要。虽然AI已被用于协助人类处理紧急情况，但NLP技术的应用仍然有限，主要集中在分类任务上，而使用NLG架构生成及时警告消息的潜力在很大程度上被忽视了。

Method: 从现有的危机描述出发，创建与场景相关的事件链，每个事件都配有一个警告消息。生成过程遵循专家编写的指南，确保术语正确性和建议的事实性。此外，每条消息都附带三种次优警告类型，以研究不同的NLG方法。

Result: 创建了包含超过40万条警告消息（涵盖近1.8万次危机情况）的数据集。进行了一系列实验，比较了监督微调设置与偏好对齐、零样本和少样本方法。进一步评估了模型在分布外场景中的性能，并评估了自动后编辑器的有效性。

Conclusion: CrisiText数据集填补了危机情况下NLG警告消息生成的空白，为研究不同NLG方法提供了基础，并展示了在危机场景中生成及时警告消息的可行性。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

*Chenyang Gu,Yewen Pu,Bruce Yang,Xiaofan Li,Huan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSPO算法，通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤增强LLM的外部知识搜索能力，在多个QA基准测试中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖提示激发模型内在代理能力，要么在复杂交互任务中应用RL时存在性能上限和崩溃问题，未能充分发挥其代理潜力

Method: DSPO算法：动态过滤序列级策略优化，通过纯RL训练实现多轮搜索和推理的交替，无需监督演示数据

Result: 7B模型在多个QA基准测试中比同类先前工作提升34.1%，在复杂多跳QA如HotpotQA中甚至超过先前工作的14B模型近9%，且保持出色的训练稳定性

Conclusion: DSPO算法能有效提升LLM的外部知识搜索能力，在复杂任务中表现出色且训练稳定

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对强化学习后训练阶段的数据污染检测方法Self-Critique，通过检测模型输出熵分布崩溃来识别污染样本，在RL-MIA基准上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着强化学习后训练在提升LLM推理能力中日益重要，现有检测方法主要针对预训练和微调阶段，缺乏专门针对RL后训练阶段的污染检测方法，这构成了关键漏洞。

Method: Self-Critique方法基于关键观察：RL阶段后，LLM的输出熵分布会崩溃为高度特定和稀疏的模式。该方法通过探测底层策略崩溃（模型收敛到狭窄推理路径）来检测污染，这种收敛会导致熵减少。

Result: 在多个模型和污染任务上的广泛实验表明，Self-Critique显著优于基线方法，AUC提升高达30%。现有方法对RL阶段污染接近随机猜测，而该方法使检测成为可能。

Conclusion: Self-Critique是首个专门针对RL后训练阶段数据污染检测的有效方法，填补了该领域的关键研究空白，为可靠评估LLM性能提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: 提出了CFVBench基准测试，评估多模态检索增强生成模型在视频理解中的能力，发现现有模型在捕捉细粒度多模态细节方面存在瓶颈，并提出了自适应视觉优化框架来改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MRAG基准测试在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面有限，主要关注单模态或有限模态任务，缺乏对细粒度多模态信息的评估。

Method: 构建CFVBench大规模基准测试，包含599个公开视频和5360个开放QA对；提出自适应视觉优化框架，通过增加帧采样密度和选择性调用外部工具来提升细粒度理解。

Result: 评估7种检索方法和14个MLLM模型，发现当前模型在捕捉瞬态细粒度多模态细节方面存在显著瓶颈；AVR框架在所有评估模型中均能提升性能。

Conclusion: 细粒度多模态理解是当前MLLM的关键挑战，提出的自适应视觉优化框架能有效提升模型在复杂视频内容中的理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

TL;DR: DyReMe是一个动态医疗诊断基准，通过生成类似真实咨询的案例来评估大语言模型，比静态基准更能反映临床实践需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态医学考试题目的LLM评估与真实临床实践脱节，高估模型性能且忽略真实世界的模糊性和多样性。

Method: DyReMe生成新鲜的咨询式案例，引入鉴别诊断、常见误诊因素等干扰项，并变化表达风格模拟真实查询习惯。

Result: 实验表明动态评估方法更具挑战性和真实性，揭示了最先进LLM与真实临床实践之间的显著不匹配。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能更好反映可信医疗诊断需求的评估框架，DyReMe为此提供了更现实的评估方法。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

*Jiuheng Lin,Cong Jiang,Zirui Wu,Jiarui Sun,Yansong Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLARity是一个成本效益高的强化学习框架，使用小型通用LLM来提升专家模型在稀缺数据领域的推理质量，通过一致性感知奖励机制和两阶段训练流程，显著改善推理一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域训练专家LLM很困难，通常依赖多项选择题。但标准的基于结果的强化学习虽然可能提高准确性，却常常降低推理质量如逻辑一致性。现有的监督推理解决方案如大规模过程奖励模型过于昂贵。

Method: 提出CLARity框架，集成一致性感知奖励机制与两阶段精炼-监控训练流程来增强推理一致性，以及动态数据重构策略来更好地利用有限数据。

Result: 实验表明CLARity相比基线方法提高了16.5%的响应一致性和7.5%的准确性。人工评估进一步确认了在连贯性和专业性方面的整体改进。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一个通用解决方案，使较小模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DualCSE方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：一个表示显式语义，另一个表示隐式语义，以解决传统句子嵌入方法只能分配单个向量的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法仅能为每个句子分配单个向量，难以捕捉句子中的隐式语义，这限制了语义表示的能力。

Method: 提出DualCSE方法，为每个句子同时生成显式语义嵌入和隐式语义嵌入，这两个嵌入在共享空间中并存，可根据特定任务需求选择使用。

Result: 实验结果表明，DualCSE能够有效编码句子的显式和隐式含义，并提升下游任务（如信息检索和文本分类）的性能。

Conclusion: DualCSE通过双嵌入表示方法成功克服了传统句子嵌入的局限性，能够更好地捕捉句子的完整语义信息。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

TL;DR: 提出了MaP框架，通过检查点合并和Pass@k指标来减少LLM预训练评估中的不稳定性，提供更可靠的训练动态观察方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练评估存在显著不稳定性，这种不稳定性掩盖了真实的学习动态，阻碍了模型研究的进展。

Method: MaP框架结合检查点合并（平滑参数空间）和Pass@k指标（提供低方差统计估计），同时解决参数不稳定性和评估不稳定性。

Result: 实验表明MaP能产生更平滑的性能曲线，减少运行间方差，确保更一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: MaP为LLM研究提供了更可靠和真实的训练动态观察方法，奠定了重要的实证基础。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法院观点生成是法律人工智能中的基础任务，但由于案件事实的多样性和复杂性，直接从原始事实生成法院观点可能限制性能表现。

Method: 构建了包含11万多个案件的中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，每个案件包含事实描述和对应的法院观点。基于此数据集训练专门的大语言模型ShiZhi。

Result: ShiZhi在法院观点生成任务上达到58.5 BLEU-1分数，在罪名预测任务上达到86.1%准确率和92.5%宏F1分数。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，即使是一个小型大语言模型，在高质量领域特定数据上训练后，也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large
language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We
construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

TL;DR: MaskKV是一个专为扩散大语言模型设计的无需训练的缓存淘汰框架，通过掩码查询引导评分和自适应缓存预算策略，在仅保留5%令牌的情况下保持94%性能，实现31倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的双向注意力缓存机制需要大量内存，限制了在资源受限环境下处理长上下文的能力。现有的缓存淘汰策略是为自回归模型设计的，忽略了扩散模型的独特特性。

Method: MaskKV包含两个关键创新：1) 掩码查询引导评分机制，利用注意力权重识别并淘汰每个注意力头中不太重要的提示令牌；2) 自适应缓存预算策略，减少中间层分配，将资源集中在偏好提示的注意力头上。

Result: 在LLaDA模型上，仅压缩到256对KV缓存（少于5%令牌）即可在LongBench上保持94%的全缓存性能，在32k提示长度下实现高达31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV有效解决了扩散大语言模型的内存瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境下的长上下文处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有的CoT验证方法基于输出或激活，对计算失败的原因提供有限洞察，需要更深入理解推理错误的方法。

Method: 使用基于电路推理验证的白盒方法，训练分类器分析正确和错误推理步骤归因图的结构特征差异。

Result: 发现错误的结构特征具有高度预测性，在不同推理任务中表现出特定计算模式，并能通过针对性干预成功修正推理错误。

Conclusion: 通过审视模型的计算过程，可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的更深层因果理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数量巨大，难以在资源受限硬件上部署。现有低秩压缩方法采用统一压缩率会导致性能显著下降，且在解码阶段表现不佳

Method: FLRC方法：1）为每层确定最优秩分配；2）引入渐进低秩解码机制来维持文本生成质量

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，FLRC相比最先进的低秩压缩方法在摘要任务上ROUGE-L指标提升达17%，建立了更鲁棒高效的LLM推理框架

Conclusion: FLRC通过细粒度秩分配和渐进解码策略，有效解决了低秩压缩中的性能下降问题，为资源受限环境下的LLM部署提供了更优解决方案

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Motivation: 解决C2C平台上个人卖家难以有效定价二手产品的问题，传统静态回归模型泛化能力差且无法捕捉市场动态变化。

Method: 使用LLM框架，首先检索相似产品，然后通过双向推理构建数据集，应用监督微调(SFT)和组相对策略优化(GRPO)两阶段优化，并采用置信度过滤机制拒绝不可靠建议。

Result: 在闲鱼平台部署后，在30%产品覆盖率下将静态采用率从40%提升到72%，在90%召回率下仍保持47%的采用率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLP框架成功解决了二手产品定价问题，通过LLM的语义理解和动态市场适应能力，实现了准确的价格建议和良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

TL;DR: ReTraceQA是一个新的基准测试，通过过程级评估来评估常识推理任务，发现SLMs在14-24%的情况下虽然给出正确答案但推理过程存在缺陷，表明仅关注最终答案的评估方法会高估SLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对小语言模型(SLMs)的评估主要依赖最终答案的准确性，而忽视了导致这些答案的推理过程的有效性，这可能导致对SLMs能力的错误估计。

Method: 引入ReTraceQA基准测试，采用专家标注的数据集，并使用大型语言模型(LLMs)作为自动化评判者进行推理感知评估。

Result: 研究发现SLMs在14-24%的情况下虽然给出正确答案但推理过程存在缺陷；使用LLMs进行推理感知评估时，SLMs在所有模型和数据集上的性能显著下降，得分最多下降25%。

Conclusion: 仅关注最终答案的评估方法会显著高估SLMs的能力，过程级评估对于准确评估语言模型的推理能力至关重要。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

TL;DR: ThinkLogit是一种无需训练的解码时方法，使用小模型指导大模型进行长链推理，通过logit运算提升推理性能。ThinkLogit-DPO进一步通过偏好优化训练指导模型，显著提升推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通常需要额外训练才能展现长链推理能力，本研究旨在探索是否可以在不训练的情况下激发这种能力，并寻找更实用的方法解锁大规模模型的长推理能力。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，利用logit运算将小推理模型作为指导器来调优目标大模型；进一步开发ThinkLogit-DPO，通过偏好优化训练指导模型，使用正确/错误推理对进行优化。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别实现了24.5%和29.1%的平均准确率相对提升，使用21倍小的指导模型成功指导32B大模型。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit方法有效且实用，即使指导模型和目标模型来自不同家族也能工作，并且与后训练方法正交，为无需昂贵后训练就能解锁大规模模型长推理能力提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NL2GenSym框架，将大语言模型与SOAR认知架构结合，从自然语言自动生成符号规则，通过执行验证和迭代优化机制，在Water Jug Problem上取得了86%的成功率和显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR认知架构需要手动编写规则，效率低下；大语言模型具有规则生成潜力但缺乏实验验证，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出NL2GenSym框架，采用执行验证的生成器-批评器机制：LLM生成器从自然语言生成规则，在SOAR环境中执行验证，基于反馈由LLM批评器迭代优化规则。

Result: 在Water Jug Problem数据集上，框架实现了超过86%的规则生成成功率，生成的新启发式规则将平均决策周期降至最优解的1.98倍，是基线方法的1/1000。

Conclusion: NL2GenSym框架成功实现了从自然语言到符号规则的自动生成，验证了LLM与认知架构集成的可行性，并发现较小参数模型也能取得更好性能。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注自回归或通用指令模型，对领域专业化大语言模型的微调机制理解不足，特别是医学等专业领域。

Method: 提出tuning vectors框架，系统分析医学领域大语言模型的微调过程，通过参数偏移方向来捕捉微调带来的变化。

Result: 发现微调仅修改表示空间的少量子集，tuning vectors能显著提升指令遵循和生成质量，跨领域组合可改善泛化能力，这些向量主要在MLP层写入新方向，在注意力头中放大现有方向。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM适应机制提供了新见解，并提供了一个通用的、可解释的分析专业化大语言模型的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO和相关熵正则化方法在链式思维推理中面临稀疏token奖励的挑战，现有方法依赖无差别的token级熵调整，经常导致熵崩溃或模型崩溃。

Method: 提出了TEPO框架，通过马尔可夫似然将组级奖励与token级聚合连接，实现token级的优化。

Result: 实验表明TEPO在关键指标（包括@k和准确率）上持续优于现有基线，在数学推理任务上达到新的最先进水平，并显著提升了训练稳定性。

Conclusion: TEPO框架有效解决了稀疏token奖励问题，为语言模型推理能力提升提供了更稳定和高效的训练方法。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度图思维链提示框架MSGCOT，通过整合图数据的多尺度结构信息来增强图提示调优的性能，特别是在少样本场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图提示调优方法局限于单粒度提示生成，忽略了图数据固有的多尺度结构信息，限制了提示语义的多样性。

Method: 设计轻量级低秩粗化网络捕获多尺度结构特征作为层次基向量，模拟人类从粗到细的认知过程，动态整合多尺度信息形成渐进式提示链。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，特别是在少样本场景下展现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 将多尺度信息整合到图提示中是有效的，MSGCOT框架通过多尺度思维链提示显著提升了图提示调优的性能。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法依赖完全标注的数据集，标注成本高昂。需要开发能够以有限标注高效识别最佳LLM的方法。

Method: 提出LLM SELECTOR框架，自适应选择信息量最大的查询子集进行标注，并利用基于评判者的标注模型进一步减少标注需求。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个LLM上的实验表明，LLM SELECTOR在选择最佳和接近最佳LLM时，能将标注成本降低高达59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR是首个主动模型选择框架，通过智能查询选择和标注策略，显著降低了LLM选择的标注成本。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过实体提及重构来研究大语言模型内部实体表示的新框架，发现LLMs开发了特定机制来表示和操作多token实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然命名实体是文本知识的基础构建块，但大语言模型如何内部表示实体仍不清楚，现有研究主要关注显式关系而非实体表示本身。

Method: 引入实体提及重构框架，利用任务向量从LLMs隐藏状态的各种实体表示中一致生成多token提及，扩展logit-lens为Entity Lens来预测多token提及。

Result: LLMs开发了实体特定机制来表示和操作任何多token实体，包括训练期间未见过的实体。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究LLMs如何编码和操作实体提供了新证据，表明模型具备表示多token实体的专门机制。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索Speech-LLMs在口语对话状态跟踪中不同上下文管理策略的效果，特别是比较传统多模态上下文、完整口语历史和压缩口语历史方法的性能差异。

Method: 系统评估了三种上下文管理策略：传统多模态上下文（结合文本历史和当前口语轮次）、完整口语历史、以及基于注意力池化的压缩口语历史方法。在SpokenWOZ语料库上进行实验。

Result: 完整口语对话作为输入在相似规模模型中表现最佳，显著超越先前方法。注意力池化压缩方法提供了良好的权衡，在减少上下文大小的同时保持了有竞争力的准确性。

Conclusion: 改进源于更有效的上下文利用，完整口语历史输入策略在口语对话状态跟踪中表现最优，而压缩方法为资源受限场景提供了实用替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for
end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically
evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed
analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context
utilization.

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Motivation: 尽管开源LLM模型增多，但其训练数据仍难以访问和分析，特别是包含从互联网抓取的关键数据。需要开发工具来增强LLM安全性和数据可访问性。

Method: 利用Elasticsearch并行索引和Alps基础设施（高效arm64超级集群），构建全文索引管道，处理大规模LLM训练数据。

Result: 成功索引了Apertus LLM家族训练数据中的8.6T tokens（共15.2T），证明了在arm64基础设施上大规模全文索引的可行性，并创建了jailbreak无关的LLM安全工具。

Conclusion: Elasticsearch可以成功移植到新一代arm64基础设施，大规模LLM训练数据的全文索引是可行的，这种索引可用于确保之前难以实现的LLM安全性，同时促进向绿色计算的转型。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Motivation: 研究神经网络模型在逻辑推理中的泛化能力，特别是区分组合性（抽象原子逻辑规则的能力）和递归性（迭代应用推理规则构建复杂表示的能力）这两个经常被混淆的方面。

Method: 使用三段论片段作为自然语言推理的基准，评估预训练大语言模型的逻辑泛化能力，并提出集成符号推理与神经计算的混合架构。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在递归性方面表现出合理熟练度，但在组合性方面存在显著困难。提出的混合架构在保持高效率的同时实现了稳健推理。

Conclusion: 混合模型有潜力有效解决神经推理系统中的关键泛化障碍，神经组件加速处理，符号推理确保完整性，即使使用相对较小的神经组件也能保持高效率。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 这是首个多模态策略内化工作，提供了数据集、训练方法和全面评估，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了第一个全面的统计学基准StatEval，包含13,817个基础问题和2,374个研究级证明任务，揭示了当前大语言模型在统计推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统计学作为一个独特且综合的学科，在基准测试工作中尚未得到充分探索，需要专门的基准来评估大语言模型的统计推理能力。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展的多智能体流水线，结合人工验证，自动化大规模问题提取、重写和质量控制，同时确保学术严谨性。

Result: 实验结果显示，闭源模型如GPT5-mini在研究级问题上准确率低于57%，开源模型表现更差，突显了统计推理的独特挑战。

Conclusion: StatEval可作为推进大语言模型统计智能的严格基准，所有数据和代码已在web平台上公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our
web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析无标签情况下模型性能估计的可靠性，发现基于大语言模型的错误预测器比基于数据漂移或零样本基线方法能产生更强、更一致的排名相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解NLP模型如何泛化时，无标签估计模型性能是一个重要目标。现有方法基于数据集相似性或预测正确性，但它们在跨域时产生可靠性能排名的条件尚不明确。

Method: 使用四类基础分类器和多个大语言模型作为错误预测器，在包含15个领域的GeoOLID和Amazon Reviews数据集上进行两步评估实验。

Result: 实验显示，基于大语言模型的错误预测器比漂移基线和零样本基线产生更强、更一致的与真实准确率的排名相关性。

Conclusion: 当跨域性能差异较大且错误模型的预测与基础模型真实失败模式一致时，性能排名更可靠。这些结果阐明了性能估计方法何时可信，并为跨域模型评估提供了指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种口音不变的ASR框架，通过口音分类和频谱图掩码增强来提高模型对不同口音的鲁棒性，在英语和波斯语上显著降低了词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的transformer模型在ASR中表现优异，但对口音和方言变化敏感，导致在英语和波斯语等语言多样性语言中词错误率较高。

Method: 训练基于频谱图的口音分类器，识别对预测影响最大的区域并进行掩码，使用掩码后的频谱图进行数据增强，提高ASR模型的口音鲁棒性。

Result: 在Whisper模型上的实验表明，该方法在英语和波斯语设置下均显著降低了词错误率，并发布了首个波斯语多地区口音数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多语言ASR系统对口音和方言多样性的适应能力，为低资源、语言多样性语言的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP)方法，通过步骤级监督来平衡大型推理模型的效率和准确性，解决过度思考问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于验证器奖励的强化学习方法虽然能减少token消耗，但往往损害模型性能，因为token级监督过于简单。

Method: 设计GRSP方法，基于推理片段进行步骤级惩罚，采用长度感知的权重机制跨片段簇进行监督。

Result: GRSP在保持准确性的同时显著提升token效率，特别是在难题上优势明显，且能稳定RL训练并有效扩展到不同模型规模。

Conclusion: 监督的粒度在平衡推理模型的效率和准确性中起关键作用，GRSP提供了一种有效的步骤级正则化方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

*Yihong Liu,Raoyuan Zhao,Lena Altinger,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，评估了18个开源LLM在5个下游任务中对拼写错误的鲁棒性，发现拼写错误会显著降低模型性能，特别是在生成性和推理任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中用户输入自然包含拼写错误，但现有基准测试大多假设干净输入，LLM在多语言环境下对拼写错误的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 开发了基于语言特定键盘布局和打字行为的MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，在3个模型家族的18个开源LLM上评估了5个下游任务。

Result: 拼写错误持续降低性能，特别是在生成任务和需要推理的任务中；指令调优可能增加对噪声的脆弱性；高资源语言比低资源语言更鲁棒；从英语翻译比翻译成英语更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 需要噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估，以提高LLM在真实多语言环境中的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，通过使用真实对数似然的上界和下界来解决扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)因其并行解码能力而成为自回归模型的高效替代品，但由于其难以处理的对数似然，无法直接应用标准策略梯度方法进行人类偏好对齐。现有方法使用ELBO等替代方案会产生显著策略梯度偏差。

Method: 提出Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，利用真实对数似然的上界和下界来减少策略梯度偏差，相比基于ELBO或一步估计的基线方法更加准确。

Result: SPG在多个任务上显著优于基线方法：GSM8K准确率提升3.6%，MATH500提升2.6%，Countdown提升18.4%，Sudoku提升27.0%。

Conclusion: SPG方法有效解决了dLLMs强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题，在多个推理任务上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

TL;DR: 论文分析了扩散大语言模型中的并行-顺序矛盾问题，发现DLLMs仅在简单任务中展现真正并行性，随着任务难度增加会退化为自回归行为，并提出了相应的缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散大语言模型在并行解码和因果推理顺序之间的内在冲突，即并行-顺序矛盾，以理解其在实际推理任务中的局限性。

Method: 通过行为分析研究DLLMs在不同难度任务中的表现，引入三个扩展维度（并行、扩散、顺序）来表征PSC，并提出并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等缓解策略。

Result: 发现DLLMs仅在可直接判定的输出上展现真正并行性，随着任务难度增加会退化为自回归行为，自回归提示会使解码步骤翻倍但质量不提升，PSC限制了自我反思、推理深度和探索广度。

Conclusion: 并行-顺序矛盾是DLLMs的核心限制因素，虽然并行扩展能带来持续改进，但扩散和顺序扩展受PSC约束，需要针对性的缓解策略来解决PSC导致的无效和低效问题。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

TL;DR: 提出了Dyna-Mind框架，通过模拟训练增强AI代理在复杂交互环境中的推理和决策能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在数学和编程领域表现出色，但在长期交互任务中表现不佳，需要模拟未来状态的能力

Method: 两阶段训练：1) ReSim通过环境交互生成结构化推理轨迹；2) Dyna-GRPO使用结果奖励和中间状态反馈强化决策

Result: 在Sokoban、ALFWorld和AndroidWorld基准测试中有效提升了代理的模拟和规划能力

Conclusion: 模拟能力对于AI代理在复杂环境中有效推理、规划和行动至关重要

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

TL;DR: 提出一个多阶段框架解决多语言医学视频检索问题，通过语义分块、知识图谱增强和层次化索引，结合粗到细的树搜索和轻量级LLM重排序，实现高效准确的多语言视频检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统要么将长视频压缩为粗略嵌入，要么进行细粒度匹配成本过高，需要解决多语言医学视频档案中复杂多跳问题的检索挑战。

Method: 将视频字幕分成语义连贯的块，用知识图谱事实增强，构建层次化树结构，使用语言无关的多语言编码器生成节点嵌入，通过粗到细树搜索剪枝，仅对排名靠前的块用轻量级LLM重排序。

Result: 在mVCR测试集上达到最先进性能，消融研究证实知识图谱增强、层次化索引和针对性LLM重排序的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究多语言链式思维推理，评估了性能、一致性和忠实性三个维度，揭示了LRMs在不同语言中的推理轨迹存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型越来越多地使用链式思维推理来提高任务性能，但在多语言环境中，导致最终答案的中间推理轨迹本身尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过测量语言遵从性、答案准确性和一致性来评估LRMs；通过跨语言交换推理轨迹评估一致性；使用截断和错误注入等扰动技术探测推理轨迹的忠实性。

Result: 发现LRMs具有强烈的语言偏好，不同语言的性能差异明显；推理轨迹的质量和有效性因提示语言而异；模型在不同语言中对推理轨迹的依赖程度不同。

Conclusion: 多语言链式思维推理存在显著的语言依赖性，推理轨迹的质量和有效性受语言影响，这为未来多语言推理研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Method: 构建包含8,880个刺激项的WUGNECTIVES数据集，评估17种不同规模和训练方案的语言模型在新实体推理任务上的表现。

Result: 调整语言模型以显示推理行为能显著改善大多数连接词的表现，但所有模型在表达让步含义的连接词上都存在系统性困难。

Conclusion: 研究为更细致地探索语言线索在语言模型中的功能作用铺平了道路，揭示了连接词类型对模型性能的重要影响。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research

Conclusion: MPS有效弥合了高质量推理与实时交互之间的差距，实现了推理性能与低延迟的良好平衡

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

Result: 在AIME2024、AIME2025、MATH500和GPQA-Diamond等数学推理基准上，P-TTS-7B和32B模型显著优于基线，在AIME'24上分别获得+26.66%和+30.00%的绝对准确率提升，在零样本泛化任务上也表现出色。

Conclusion: P-TTS提供了一种实用、低成本的解决方案，能够有效探索推理模式的潜在空间，在资源受限或快速发展的领域中释放LLM的推理潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

### [202] [Understanding and Predicting Temporal Visual Attention Influenced by Dynamic Highlights in Monitoring Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08777)
*Zekun Wu,Anna Maria Feit*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究了视觉高亮在无人机监控任务中对用户注视行为的影响，发现高亮区域具有独特的时序特征，开发了HISM模型来预测这些动态变化，为监控界面设计提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控界面在动态高风险任务中至关重要，视觉高亮能有效引导注意力但也可能带来意外干扰，需要研究其具体影响。

Method: 通过分析用户在无人机监控任务中的注视行为，量化高亮区域的时序特征，开发了Highlight-Informed Saliency Model (HISM)来预测标准化显著性随时间的变化。

Result: 高亮区域能快速引发用户响应（NS快速达到峰值），但会减少对其他区域的搜索努力，可能影响情境感知。HISM模型能准确预测NS随时间的变化。

Conclusion: 视觉高亮在监控界面中具有双重效应，HISM模型可为界面设计提供评估工具，帮助优化高亮的时机和部署策略，特别是在时间敏感任务中。

Abstract: Monitoring interfaces are crucial for dynamic, highstakes tasks where
effective user attention is essential. Visual highlights can guide attention
effectively but may also introduce unintended disruptions. To investigate this,
we examined how visual highlights affect users' gaze behavior in a drone
monitoring task, focusing on when, how long, and how much attention they draw.
We found that highlighted areas exhibit distinct temporal characteristics
compared to non-highlighted ones, quantified using normalized saliency (NS)
metrics. Highlights elicited immediate responses, with NS peaking quickly, but
this shift came at the cost of reduced search efforts elsewhere, potentially
impacting situational awareness. To predict these dynamic changes and support
interface design, we developed the Highlight-Informed Saliency Model (HISM),
which provides granular predictions of NS over time. These predictions enable
evaluations of highlight effectiveness and inform the optimal timing and
deployment of highlights in future monitoring interface designs, particularly
for time-sensitive tasks.

TL;DR: 研究探讨多模态大语言模型能否在早期UI设计阶段模拟人类偏好来评估界面，发现模型在某些维度上能近似人类判断但在其他维度存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的早期设计阶段，需要一种能够替代正式用户研究的方法来验证UI设计决策，多模态大语言模型为此提供了可能。

Method: 使用众包平台数据，对GPT-4o、Claude和Llama模型在30个界面上进行基准测试，考察它们与人类判断在多个UI因素上的一致性。

Result: 多模态大语言模型在某些维度上能够近似人类偏好，但在其他维度上与人类判断存在分歧。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在补充早期用户体验研究方面具有潜力，但也存在局限性，需要谨慎使用。

Abstract: In an ideal design pipeline, user interface (UI) design is intertwined with
user research to validate decisions, yet studies are often resource-constrained
during early exploration. Recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) offer a promising opportunity to act as early evaluators, helping
designers narrow options before formal testing. Unlike prior work that
emphasizes user behavior in narrow domains such as e-commerce with metrics like
clicks or conversions, we focus on subjective user evaluations across varied
interfaces. We investigate whether MLLMs can mimic human preferences when
evaluating individual UIs and comparing them. Using data from a crowdsourcing
platform, we benchmark GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama across 30 interfaces and
examine alignment with human judgments on multiple UI factors. Our results show
that MLLMs approximate human preferences on some dimensions but diverge on
others, underscoring both their potential and limitations in supplementing
early UX research.

a reward-based mobile or web app to encourage user participation. Additionally,
Green Grid offers analytics dashboards and an eco-marketplace to support
policymakers and recyclers. By bridging technology, sustainability, and
community participation, the platform enhances transparency, increases formal
recycling rates, and advances India's transition toward a circular economy.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文设计了一个模拟人类打字行为（包括犹豫和自我编辑）的交互平台，通过用户实验发现结合这两种行为的AI代理在自然度和可信度方面更受青睐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成回复速度过快，缺乏人类思考和打字过程中的犹豫、自我编辑等特征，影响了对话的自然度和可信度。

Method: 构建交互平台，用户可调整参数个性化AI沟通风格；进行用户实验，比较基线代理、模拟犹豫代理、结合犹豫和自我编辑行为代理三种类型。

Result: 用户实验显示，结合犹豫和自我编辑行为的代理最受青睐，在感知自然度和可信度方面有所改善。

Conclusion: 该研究为对话AI的多模态交互设计和用户体验做出贡献，倡导更人性化、吸引人和可信的沟通范式。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have facilitated the emergence of highly
intelligent conversational AI capable of engaging in human-like dialogues.
However, a notable distinction lies in the fact that these AI models
predominantly generate responses rapidly, often producing extensive content
without emulating the thoughtful process characteristic of human cognition and
typing. This paper presents a design aimed at simulating human-like typing
behaviors, including patterns such as hesitation and self-editing, as well as a
preliminary user experiment to understand whether and to what extent the agent
with human-like typing behaviors could potentially affect conversational
engagement and its trustworthiness. We've constructed an interactive platform
featuring user-adjustable parameters, allowing users to personalize the AI's
communication style and thus cultivate a more enriching and immersive
conversational experience. Our user experiment, involving interactions with
three types of agents - a baseline agent, one simulating hesitation, and
another integrating both hesitation and self-editing behaviors - reveals a
preference for the agent that incorporates both behaviors, suggesting an
improvement in perceived naturalness and trustworthiness. Through the insights
from our design process and both quantitative and qualitative feedback from
user experiments, this paper contributes to the multimodal interaction design
and user experience for conversational AI, advocating for a more human-like,
engaging, and trustworthy communication paradigm.

Method: 进行了一项受控研究（N=15），要求参与者使用聊天机器人完成安全相关任务。在参与者不知情的情况下，聊天机器人被操控为某些任务提供错误建议。

Result: 结果显示用户对AI聊天机器人的信任与任务熟悉度和自身判断信心相关。研究还探讨了人们在不同场景下信任或不信任AI聊天机器人的可能原因。

Conclusion: AI聊天机器人可能被恶意操控来误导用户，特别是在安全相关任务中。用户对AI的信任受到任务熟悉度和自身判断信心的影响，这突显了AI系统安全性的重要性。

Abstract: AI chatbots are an emerging security attack vector, vulnerable to threats
such as prompt injection, and rogue chatbot creation. When deployed in domains
such as corporate security policy, they could be weaponized to deliver guidance
that intentionally undermines system defenses. We investigate whether users can
be tricked by a compromised AI chatbot in this scenario. A controlled study
(N=15) asked participants to use a chatbot to complete security-related tasks.
Without their knowledge, the chatbot was manipulated to give incorrect advice
for some tasks. The results show how trust in AI chatbots is related to task
familiarity, and confidence in their ownn judgment. Additionally, we discuss
possible reasons why people do or do not trust AI chatbots in different
scenarios.

Motivation: 基于自然语言的用户配置文件具有可解释性，能帮助用户审视和优化兴趣，从而提高推荐质量。现有配置文件通常是静态的，无法让用户直接参与修改和反思。

Method: 设计了一个人机协作配置文件，展示用户电影历史的可编辑个性化兴趣摘要。在8周在线实地部署中，与1775名活跃电影推荐用户进行实验。

Result: 发现用户感知兴趣与系统推断兴趣存在持续差距，该配置文件设计能促进用户参与和反思，识别了利用不完美AI配置文件刺激更多用户干预的设计方向。

Conclusion: 这种人机协作配置文件可以建立更透明和可信赖的推荐体验，通过让用户直接检查和修改系统推断来增强系统的透明度和用户信任。

Abstract: Natural language-based user profiles in recommender systems have been
explored for their interpretability and potential to help users scrutinize and
refine their interests, thereby improving recommendation quality. Building on
this foundation, we introduce a human-AI collaborative profile for a movie
recommender system that presents editable personalized interest summaries of a
user's movie history. Unlike static profiles, this design invites users to
directly inspect, modify, and reflect on the system's inferences. In an
eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we
find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show
how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design
directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more
user intervention and build more transparent and trustworthy recommender
experiences.

TL;DR: 提出了Promptimizer，一种用户中心的提示优化技术，允许用户在优化过程中提供输入，并生成可解释的最终提示，优于完全自动化的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化技术未能考虑社交媒体用户希望在使用过程中如何演变其过滤器，包括在初始化和迭代阶段以不同方式引导的需求。

Method: 开发了Promptimizer用户中心提示优化技术，支持用户参与优化过程并生成可解释提示，并集成到Puffin工具中支持YouTube创作者管理评论。

Result: 实验室实验显示用户显著偏好Promptimizer的人机协作优化；3周部署中10位创作者成功创建多样化过滤器来理解受众和保护社区。

Conclusion: Promptimizer在保持高性能和易用性的同时，通过用户参与和可解释性，有效支持内容分类器的创建和维护。

Abstract: While LLMs now enable users to create content classifiers easily through
natural language, automatic prompt optimization techniques are often necessary
to create performant classifiers. However, such techniques can fail to consider
how social media users want to evolve their filters over the course of usage,
including desiring to steer them in different ways during initialization and
iteration. We introduce a user-centered prompt optimization technique,
Promptimizer, that maintains high performance and ease-of-use but additionally
(1) allows for user input into the optimization process and (2) produces final
prompts that are interpretable. A lab experiment (n=16) found that users
significantly preferred Promptimizer's human-in-the-loop optimization over a
fully automatic approach. We further implement Promptimizer into Puffin, a tool
to support YouTube content creators in creating and maintaining personal
classifiers to manage their comments. Over a 3-week deployment with 10
creators, participants successfully created diverse filters to better
understand their audiences and protect their communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RDWT作为预处理步骤是否能提升深度学习模型在运动想象脑电信号解码中的性能，特别是在具有挑战性的记录条件下。

Method: 使用四种深度学习架构(EEGNet、ShallowConvNet、MBEEG_SENet、EEGTCNet)在三个基准数据集(High Gamma、BCI-IV-2a、BCI-IV-2b)上进行有/无RDWT预处理的配对评估。

Result: RDWT在不同数据集和模型上均显示出性能提升，特别是在BCI-IV-2a数据集上对EEGTCNet(+4.44pp)和MBEEG_SENet(+2.23pp)有显著改进，在挑战性记录中表现更佳。

Conclusion: RDWT是一种低开销、架构感知的预处理技术，能够为深度学习模型家族和困难受试者带来准确性和一致性方面的切实增益。

Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of the Rational Discrete Wavelet
Transform (RDWT), used as a plug-in preprocessing step for motor imagery
electroencephalographic (EEG) decoding prior to applying deep learning
classifiers. A systematic paired evaluation (with/without RDWT) is conducted on
four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: EEGNet, ShallowConvNet,
MBEEG\_SENet, and EEGTCNet. This evaluation was carried out across three
benchmark datasets: High Gamma, BCI-IV-2a, and BCI-IV-2b. The performance of
the RDWT is reported with subject-wise averages using accuracy and Cohen's
kappa, complemented by subject-level analyses to identify when RDWT is
beneficial. On BCI-IV-2a, RDWT yields clear average gains for EEGTCNet (+4.44
percentage points, pp; kappa +0.059) and MBEEG\_SENet (+2.23 pp; +0.030), with
smaller improvements for EEGNet (+2.08 pp; +0.027) and ShallowConvNet (+0.58
pp; +0.008). On BCI-IV-2b, the enhancements observed are modest yet consistent
for EEGNet (+0.21 pp; +0.044) and EEGTCNet (+0.28 pp; +0.077). On HGD, average
effects are modest to positive, with the most significant gain observed for
MBEEG\_SENet (+1.65 pp; +0.022), followed by EEGNet (+0.76 pp; +0.010) and
EEGTCNet (+0.54 pp; +0.008). Inspection of the subject material reveals
significant enhancements in challenging recordings (e.g., non-stationary
sessions), indicating that RDWT can mitigate localized noise and enhance
rhythm-specific information. In conclusion, RDWT is shown to be a low-overhead,
architecture-aware preprocessing technique that can yield tangible gains in
accuracy and agreement for deep model families and challenging subjects.

Method: 通过访谈（13人）和问卷调查（169人）收集计算课程教师的实践经验数据。

Result: 识别出教师面临的五大障碍：课程修订共识不足、机构政策指导模糊、实施挑战、评估不匹配以及资源缺乏。

Conclusion: 提出了紧急教学设计作为HCI的独特设计情境，并为HCI研究者、学术机构和组织提供了支持教师适应GenAI的具体建议。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are increasingly pervasive, pushing instructors
to redesign how students use GenAI tools in coursework. We conceptualize this
work as emergency pedagogical design: reactive, indirect efforts by instructors
to shape student-AI interactions without control over commercial interfaces. To
understand practices of lead users conducting emergency pedagogical design, we
conducted interviews (n=13) and a survey (n=169) of computing instructors.
These instructors repeatedly encountered five barriers: fragmented buy-in for
revising courses; policy crosswinds from non-prescriptive institutional
guidance; implementation challenges as instructors attempt interventions;
assessment misfit as student-AI interactions are only partially visible to
instructors; and lack of resources, including time, staffing, and paid tool
access. We use these findings to present emergency pedagogical design as a
distinct design setting for HCI and outline recommendations for HCI
researchers, academic institutions, and organizations to effectively support
instructors in adapting courses to GenAI.

of their personal libraries. The tool also caters to the growing trend of
social sharing within online book communities, allowing users to create
visually appealing representations of their libraries that can be easily shared

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the
brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a
low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a
comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory
stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity
tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a
virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were
captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain
was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440
Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional
"knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased
systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only
trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3,
respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited
stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force
needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These
results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce
and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators,
opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and
assistive interfaces.

Abstract: Intelligence analysts perform sensemaking over collections of documents using
various visual and analytic techniques to gain insights from large amounts of
text. As data scales grow, our work explores how to leverage two AI
technologies, large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), in a
visual text analysis tool, enhancing sensemaking and helping analysts keep
pace. Collaborating with intelligence community experts, we developed a visual
analytics system called VisPile. VisPile integrates an LLM and a KG into
various UI functions that assist analysts in grouping documents into piles,
performing sensemaking tasks like summarization and relationship mapping on
piles, and validating LLM- and KG-generated evidence. Our paper describes the
tool, as well as feedback received from six professional intelligence analysts
that used VisPile to analyze a text document corpus.

### [217] [Energy-Driven Steering: Reducing False Refusals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08646)
*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Weixuan Ou,Run Liu,Shengyuan Pang,Guancheng Wan,Ranjie Duan,Wei Dong,Kai-Wei Chang,XiaoFeng Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Xinfeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Energy-Driven Steering (EDS)框架，通过基于能量的模型在推理时动态引导LLM隐藏状态，同时提升安全性和减少错误拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐技术往往过度谨慎，导致对良性提示也错误拒绝，需要同时提升安全性和降低错误拒绝率。

Method: 训练轻量级外部能量模型，在推理时根据LLM内部激活映射能量景观，通过能量梯度动态引导隐藏状态到低能量区域。

Result: 在ORB-H基准上，合规率从57.3%提升至82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能。

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效的范式，使LLM能够同时实现低错误拒绝率和高安全性。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON是一个后处理诊断工具包，通过检查内部表示的循环和重排序来检测大语言模型在无害编辑下的答案变化问题，帮助提高模型可靠性而不改变架构或训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对实际应用中的无害编辑时会出现答案不一致的问题，如RAG输出随段落重排序而改变、微调削弱预训练学到的恒定性等，这些违反预期不变性的问题会破坏持续集成并迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON结合了基于位置和层的无逆曲率映射（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）与激活级交换子来标记重排序风险，这些信号计算成本低、对标准Transformer模型通用，并以阈值和CSV格式输出供编排器使用。

Result: WILSON能够实现具体行动：保护RAG免受顺序效应影响、捕获微调回归、稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文、在部署中控制融合或重排序操作。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使可靠性和吞吐量能够共同提升，而无需改变模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

TL;DR: RareNet是一种基于子图的图神经网络，仅需患者表型数据即可识别最可能的致病基因，为罕见遗传病诊断提供可解释的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临三大挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、致病基因数量庞大，导致诊断周期长、治疗不当和关键延误，特别是在资源有限地区。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别最可能的致病基因，并检索相关的患者子图用于临床调查。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现复杂遗传分析，特别适合缺乏先进基因组基础设施的服务不足人群，有助于实现诊断工具的民主化。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

TL;DR: 提出两种点级方法LD和LCD来解决时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，通过在不同时间步使用不同参数来消除内部差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，导致分布偏移，现有实例归一化方法无法处理实例内分布偏移，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出LD方法通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入和输出的内部分布，LCD方法使用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中与各种骨干模型结合评估，证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能有效解决时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对语言赋能基础模型（LeFMs）的可证明鲁棒少样本分类器LeFCert，通过双重修剪均值原型和自适应混合机制，在中毒攻击下提供可证明的鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LeFMs的少样本分类器依赖开放环境中收集的小型支持数据集，容易受到中毒攻击，而现有防御方法缺乏形式化保证且对未知和自适应攻击脆弱。

Method: LeFCert整合文本和特征嵌入与自适应混合机制，提出双重修剪均值原型，推导分类分数的可证明上下界。扩展版本LeFCert-L引入随机平滑提供Lipschitz连续性，LeFCert-C提供集体认证。

Result: 实验表明LeFCert实现了最先进的性能，相比现有基线显著提高了干净准确率和认证准确率，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: LeFCert是首个为LeFMs设计的可证明鲁棒少样本分类器，在保持高效计算的同时提供强大的鲁棒性保证，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了高维数据可视化中常用的质量评估指标（归一化应力和KL散度）对尺度变化的敏感性，并提出了一种简单方法使这些指标具有尺度不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据可视化中，二维散点图是常用方法，但评估这些投影的准确性具有挑战性。常用的质量评估指标如归一化应力和KL散度对尺度变化敏感，即使尺度变化不会实质改变投影的性质。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究尺度对应力和KL散度的影响，提出了一种简单技术使这两个质量指标具有尺度不变性。

Result: 研究表明尺度变化会显著改变质量指标值，影响降维技术的评估。提出的尺度不变方法在小基准测试中准确捕捉了预期行为。

Conclusion: 当前常用的可视化质量评估指标存在尺度敏感性缺陷，提出的尺度不变方法能够更准确地评估降维投影的质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示线性模型能达到与复杂架构相当的预测性能，但增强线性模型的方法仍未被充分探索。假设不同时间序列实例可能遵循异质线性映射。

Method: 使用分类辅助通道独立机制动态路由实例到专用预测器；重新设计趋势-季节性分解架构，添加解耦-线性映射-重耦合框架处理趋势分量，使用复数域线性投影处理季节性分量。

Result: 大量实验验证CATS-Linear在固定超参数下达到与超参数调优基线相当的SOTA精度，同时在固定超参数对比中提供SOTA精度。

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过动态实例路由和改进的分解架构有效提升了线性模型的预测性能，在固定超参数设置下实现竞争性结果。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因组选择方法在处理复杂性状和大数据集时预测精度不足，需要更有效的模型来捕捉复杂的基因型-表型关系。

Method: 使用8维one-hot编码处理SNP数据，按染色体排序，采用PMF算法进行特征选择，结合CNN和自注意力机制构建DPCformer模型。

Result: 在5种作物的13个性状上测试，玉米性状预测精度提升达2.92%，棉花纤维性状精度提升8.37%，番茄小样本场景PCC提升57.35%，鹰嘴豆产量相关性提升16.62%。

Conclusion: DPCformer在精度、小样本鲁棒性和可解释性方面表现优异，为精准育种和应对全球粮食安全挑战提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，分别处理低频和高频特征，显著降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这一假设并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，低频分量具有高相似性但连续性差，高频分量则连续性高但相似性差，这促使设计针对不同频率特性的缓存策略。

Method: 提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)：直接重用相似性高的低频分量特征，使用二阶Hermite插值器基于连续性预测易变的高频分量。同时提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)而非所有层特征，将内存占用减少99%。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等多个数据集上的实验证明了该方法在生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存通过针对性处理不同频率分量的特性，有效解决了扩散变换器推理成本高的问题，同时大幅减少了内存占用。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出LENS方法改进GRPO，通过为错误回答分配置信度相关的奖励，使负样本组产生有用梯度，提高RLVR训练效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在负样本组（无正确答案的组）中浪费计算资源，因为这些组产生零优势和无梯度

Method: 从奖励建模的最大似然目标出发，推导出等价于修改价值函数的策略梯度，为错误回答添加置信度加权的惩罚

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，LENS方法显著优于GRPO基线，在困难题目上表现更好

Conclusion: LENS提供了一种原则性和实用的方法来利用负样本组，提高RLVR的效率和性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

Conclusion: 上下文学习有望成为下一代无线基础模型的关键技术，为开发具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的通信系统提供重要见解。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过将每个数据实例视为独立类别，鼓励模型学习对数据变换具有不变性的表示，从而在没有人工标注的情况下获得有意义的特征表示。

Method: 对每个实例应用随机变换生成两个不同的视图，训练模型将这些不同视图的表示映射到同一特征空间，使模型能够识别出这些视图来自同一实例。

Result: 模型能够学习到对数据变换具有不变性的特征表示，这些表示能够捕捉数据中的本质特征，而忽略不相关的变换因素。

Conclusion: 实例判别是一种有效的自监督学习方法，通过将实例视为类别并学习视图不变性表示，能够在无监督设置下获得有意义的特征表示。

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn
representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these
views.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注点预测器的反事实公平性，而预测集在不确定性下的公平决策中至关重要。同时，保形预测能提供有效的预测集但不保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对称化保护属性干预的符合性分数来开发CF-CP方法，该方法不需要重新训练模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的回归和分类任务中，CF-CP实现了期望的反事实公平性，并以最小的预测集大小增加达到了目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: CF-CP为反事实公平的不确定性量化提供了一种简单、无需训练的途径。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型推理时控制技术（如激活向量修改或权重矩阵更新）多基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在为这些干预技术提供数学基础。

Method: 基于Dherin等人(2025)关于提示影响可映射为隐式权重更新的发现，将理论推广到深度多块transformer架构，推导出将文本信息压缩为token无关的思想向量和思想矩阵的方法。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

### [231] [SHAP-Based Supervised Clustering for Sample Classification and the Generalized Waterfall Plot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08737)
*Justin Lin,Julia Fukuyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SHAP值聚类的方法来解释黑盒模型预测，通过将具有相似预测原因的样本分组来揭示不同的预测路径，并在阿尔茨海默病案例中验证了该方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒模型虽然能处理复杂数据关系，但缺乏可解释性，这在高风险应用中存在问题。SHAP分析能解释模型预测，但需要进一步分析来理解不同样本获得相同预测的相似原因。

Method: 对数据集中每个样本和特征的SHAP值进行聚类，将获得相同预测且预测原因相似的样本分组，从而映射出不同的预测路径。还提出了多分类瀑布图的新泛化方法。

Result: 通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究（使用ADNI数据库数据）验证了该方法的有效性，成功识别了不同的预测模式。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类方法能够有效解释黑盒模型的预测过程，为高风险应用中的模型可解释性提供了有价值的工具，特别是在医疗诊断等领域。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

*Yikai Zhao,Jiekai Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个双管齐下的框架，通过替代模型解释和频谱可预测性分析，解决复杂时间序列集成模型的解释性和可预测性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代时间序列预测依赖AutoML系统生成的复杂集成模型，虽然精度高但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要解决准确性与可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1. 训练LightGBM替代模型来模拟AutoGluon的时间序列预测，实现稳定的SHAP特征归因；2. 集成频谱可预测性分析，通过比较时间序列与纯噪声基准的频谱可预测性来量化预测置信度。

Result: 在M5数据集上的实证评估表明，更高的频谱可预测性不仅与改善的预测准确性相关，还与替代模型和原始模型之间的更高保真度相关。特征注入实验验证了SHAP值的忠实性。

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进的集成预测提供了可解释的实例级解释，同时通过可预测性指标为用户提供了预测及其解释的可靠性指示器。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

TL;DR: DemoDiff是一种基于演示条件扩散模型的分子设计方法，通过少量分子-评分示例定义任务上下文，在33个设计任务中超越大100-1000倍的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子设计中上下文学习效果有限的问题，利用ChEMBL等数据库中大量但每个属性标记数据稀缺的分子特性数据。

Method: 使用演示条件扩散模型，通过少量分子-评分示例指导去噪Transformer生成目标属性分子；开发节点对编码分子分词器，减少5.5倍节点数；在包含数百万上下文任务的数据集上预训练7亿参数模型。

Result: 在6个类别33个设计任务中，DemoDiff匹配或超越大100-1000倍的语言模型，平均排名3.63，优于领域特定方法的5.25-10.20。

Conclusion: DemoDiff可作为上下文分子设计的分子基础模型，在分子生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

TL;DR: RFOD是一个基于随机森林的表格数据异常检测框架，通过特征级条件重构处理混合类型数据，结合调整后的Gower距离和不确定性加权平均实现精确可解释的异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在处理混合类型表格数据时存在语义信息丢失和可解释性不足的问题，在网络安全、金融欺诈检测和医疗等高风险领域需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将异常检测重构为特征级条件重构问题，为每个特征训练专门的随机森林模型，使用调整后的Gower距离进行单元格级评分，并通过不确定性加权平均聚合为行级异常分数。

Result: 在15个真实数据集上的实验表明，RFOD在检测准确率上持续优于最先进的基线方法，同时为混合类型表格数据提供了更好的鲁棒性、可扩展性和可解释性。

Conclusion: RFOD框架有效解决了混合类型表格数据异常检测的挑战，在保持语义完整性的同时提供了精确且可解释的检测结果。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种控制优化确定性等价(OCE)风险的方法，扩展了传统的保形风险控制框架，能够处理尾部风险，并引入了端到端的保形风险训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型虽然预测准确率高，但缺乏可证明的风险或可靠性保证，这在高风险应用中至关重要。现有保形风险控制方法只能控制期望损失，无法处理对尾部风险敏感的实际应用。

Method: 开发了控制OCE风险类的方法，包括条件风险价值等尾部风险度量；引入了端到端的保形风险训练，在模型训练或微调期间通过保形OCE风险控制进行微分。

Result: 方法在控制分类器假阴性率和电池存储操作中的金融风险应用中，相比后处理方法显著提高了平均性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法实现了可证明的风险保证，同时在实际应用中显著优于后处理方法的平均性能表现。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化客户端内和客户端间的细粒度跨样本记忆化，揭示了FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FL记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的微妙风险，而集中式学习的细粒度方法无法直接应用于FL。

Method: 提出一个框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量来量化FL中的客户端内和客户端间记忆化，并研究解码策略、前缀长度和FL算法等关键因素。

Result: FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据多于客户端间数据，记忆化受训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: 联邦学习存在数据记忆化风险，需要更细粒度的检测方法，记忆化程度受多种训练和推理因素影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

*Mujin Kwun,Depen Morwani,Chloe Huangyuan Su,Stephanie Gil,Nikhil Anand,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LOTION框架，通过随机噪声平滑方法解决量化神经网络优化中的梯度问题，确保标准优化器能收敛到局部最小值，并在语言模型上优于标准QAT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，除了量化阈值处导数未定义外，其他地方梯度为零。现有方法使用STE等技术放松梯度计算，但无法保证收敛。

Method: 受Nesterov平滑启发，提出LOTION框架，用无偏随机舍入噪声下的期望损失来近似量化损失表面，将原始量化损失替换为连续损失表面。

Result: 在该框架下，标准优化器能保证收敛到损失表面的局部最小值；使用随机舍入噪声时，原始量化损失的全局最小值得以保留；在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上表现优于标准QAT。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有理论保证的平滑框架，有效解决了量化优化中的梯度问题，并在实际应用中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

TL;DR: 提出Spatial Deconfounder方法，通过利用干扰揭示潜在混杂因子结构，同时解决空间因果推断中的未测量混杂和干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织挑战：未测量的空间混杂因子（如天气、污染）和附近处理的干扰效应。现有方法通常只解决其中一个而忽略另一个。

Method: 两阶段方法：使用带空间先验的条件变分自编码器从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学真实数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder持续改进效应估计，扩展了SpaCE基准套件以包含处理干扰。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要穷举参数组合，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 使用虚拟成像工具模拟人体肝脏病变模型，结合PPO强化学习算法优化管电压、管电流、重建核等参数，以最大化病变可检测性指数

Result: 强化学习方法在所有测试案例中都达到了全局最大可检测性指数，比穷举搜索节省79.7%的计算步骤

Conclusion: 虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合为CT协议管理提供了准确且计算高效的优化框架

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Motivation: 强化学习策略在面临新机器人、任务或不同物理参数环境时泛化能力差，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于白金汉π定理，通过将策略的输入（观测）和输出（动作）缩放到无量纲空间，实现预训练策略对新系统环境的适应。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的环境中验证：模拟摆、物理摆（sim-to-real验证）和高维HalfCheetah。缩放迁移在动态相似环境下无性能损失，在非相似环境下始终优于朴素迁移。

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强RL策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL智能体在稀疏奖励环境中难以发现有效动作序列，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法要么强制RL策略遵循LLM建议，要么将其直接纳入奖励函数，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，允许RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力，同时通过软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中评估，LLM指导的益处随任务难度增加而增强。在最复杂环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍，且无需修改现有RL算法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM的规划能力加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，展示了LLM指导的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三个主要挑战：(i) 每个目标函数都需要从头训练新模型；(ii) 性能对架构和超参数选择高度敏感；(iii) 模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 首先在参考域上训练基神经网络来逼近多项式族，然后将学习到的参数用于初始化更复杂目标函数的网络。引入域映射机制将任意域输入变换到参考域，保持与预训练模型的结构对应性。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案，完整代码已在Gitee上公开。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: PO-CKAN是一个基于分块有理Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的物理信息深度算子框架，用于近似偏微分方程的解算子，相比PI-DeepONet在Burgers方程上相对L2误差降低了约48%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够高效学习物理一致的时空解算子，并能快速预测参数化时变偏微分方程在不同输入条件下的解。

Method: 采用DeepONet分支-主干架构，子网络实现为有理KAN模块，通过PDE残差损失(PINN风格)强制物理一致性。

Result: 在Burgers方程(ν=0.01)上，PO-CKAN相比PI-DeepONet将平均相对L2误差降低了约48%，在Eikonal和扩散-反应基准测试中达到竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够准确学习算子，结果与高保真解高度匹配，验证了其在挑战性基准问题上的有效性。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Method: 创建TAPAS数据集工具包，涵盖多种LWE设置，为AI实践者提供即用型数据集来开发新的LWE破解方法。

Result: 建立了TAPAS数据集创建文档、攻击性能基准，并为未来工作指明了方向。

Conclusion: TAPAS数据集填补了AI研究LWE攻击的数据空白，有望加速后量子密码学领域的AI研究进展。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

TL;DR: 提出了Edu-EmotionNet框架，用于在线教育中的情感识别，通过动态融合策略和模态可靠性建模来提升识别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖静态融合策略并假设模态输入始终可靠，这在真实学习环境中很少成立，需要更鲁棒的方法来理解学习者情绪。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块用于动态跨模态上下文共享，模态重要性估计器为每个时间步的模态分配基于置信度的权重，时间反馈循环利用先前预测来保持时间一致性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MOSEI的教育子集上评估，针对困惑、好奇、无聊和沮丧情绪，实现了最先进性能，并对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够捕捉情感转换并自适应优先处理可靠信号，非常适合部署在实时学习系统中。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Motivation: 现实世界数据分布往往存在不平衡（长尾）特性，这导致深度分类模型偏向频繁类别，在尾部类别上表现不佳。需要解决这种多数类偏见问题同时保留数据集中的有价值信息。

Result: 在多个长尾基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，通过广泛实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效缓解长尾数据分布中的多数类偏见问题，同时保持模型的整体性能，为不平衡学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Motivation: 边缘环境中的动态资源可用性（如图像质量下降、网络不稳定、服务器负载波动）对实时3D重建的可靠性构成挑战，特别是在消防救援等关键应用中需要及时准确的三维场景建模。

Method: 采用两个协同Q学习代理：一个负责相机选择，一个负责服务器选择，两者完全在线运行，通过与边缘环境交互学习策略。在包含实验室设备和FABRIC基础设施的分布式测试床上进行实现和评估。

Result: 该框架在动态环境中有效平衡端到端延迟和重建质量，提高了应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中确保3D重建的高质量和及时性。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有机器学习公平性研究主要关注医学图像诊断任务，忽略了预后场景中的时间到事件预测公平性问题。

Method: 开发FairTTE框架，整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，采用因果分析技术识别和量化医学影像数据集中的偏见来源。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见在不同成像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，分布偏移下公平性维护更加困难。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，以及更稳健、公平的预后模型来解决医学影像预后中的公平性问题。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

Conclusion: 提出的基于CNN的多模态子空间聚类框架通过有效的融合策略和自表达机制，在多模态数据聚类任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但缺乏对表示层面对齐性的研究，需要验证CL和NSCL是否在训练过程中保持表示对齐。

Method: 在共享随机性条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析其相似性矩阵的接近程度，并提供CKA和RSA对齐度量的概率保证。

Result: 证明CL和NSCL的表示保持相似，相似性矩阵在现实条件下接近，且对齐度随类别数、温度增加而改善，但参数空间可能指数级发散。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的桥梁，CL-NSCL表示对齐随规模和温度增强，NSCL比其它监督目标更接近CL。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为

Method: ATM通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制进行特征选择

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs显著降低了吸收分数，同时保持了优秀的重构质量

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定了基础

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Method: 使用稀疏分解方法识别各视觉流的主导组件，并引入SCA方法来测量大脑与机器视觉系统的表征对齐。

Result: 发现腹侧流对脸、地点、身体、文字、食物敏感；外侧流对社会互动、暗示运动、手部动作敏感；背侧流组件较难解释。SCA显示DNN与腹侧流对齐度更高。

Conclusion: SCA方法比传统群体水平几何方法能更精细地揭示大脑与机器视觉系统的表征对齐差异，对神经调谐的潜在轴更敏感。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗环境，且存在遗憾上下界之间的差距问题。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，通过纯信息增益驱动探索，移除乐观主义，使其能够处理对抗环境。同时改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC总是小于等于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下更小。在混合MDP中获得了首个模型自由遗憾界，并将遗憾界从T^{3/4}提升到T^{2/3}（在线策略），从T^{5/6}提升到T^{7/9}（离线策略）。在贝尔曼完备MDP中，遗憾界从T^{2/3}提升到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC填补了DMSO在对抗环境中的理论空白，首次使基于DEC的方法在贝尔曼完备MDP中达到与乐观主义方法相当的性能。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie

TL;DR: 提出了ACPO框架，通过难度感知课程和基于归因的策略优化来解决RLVR中的探索-利用平衡问题，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法在复杂推理中存在探索与利用不平衡的问题，导致中间步骤信用分配不准确和过早的熵崩溃，限制了模型性能。

Method: ACPO框架包含：1）基于轨迹语义分割和归因表示的动态策略熵调节；2）分解奖励系统精确量化推理步骤的层次贡献；3）难度感知课程学习。

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等挑战性基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACPO通过改进探索和利用的平衡，有效解决了RLVR中的信用分配和熵崩溃问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新颖的频域分析框架，将多臂老虎机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，证明了UCB算法中的置信区间项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多臂老虎机分析主要从时间域和累积遗憾角度出发，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来更好地理解探索与利用的权衡。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，其不确定性对应分量频率，将老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器，并证明UCB算法在频域的等价性。

Result: 证明了置信区间项在频域中等效于与访问次数平方根成反比的时变增益，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态界限。

Conclusion: 该理论不仅为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，还为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM和DDPG的优化方法来解决车联网中SPS调度导致的AoI恶化问题，通过双路径优化方案降低信息年龄。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车联网中半持续调度(SPS)由于数据包碰撞和车辆速度相关的信道不确定性导致的信息年龄(AoI)恶化问题。

Method: 建立受车辆速度、密度和资源预留间隔影响的AoI计算模型，设计双路径优化方案：DDPG基于状态空间和奖励函数进行优化，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后获得更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG相结合的双路径优化方法能有效解决车联网中的AoI优化问题，LLM具有快速部署优势，DDPG提供稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对小地球数据的时空预测方法，通过量化时空模式并利用表格基础模型实现跨场景的准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型需要针对不同场景进行特定训练，而基础模型存在对预训练分布全局均值的预测偏差问题。

Method: 通过表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三个典型场景中的比较结果表明，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）具有更高的准确性和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为小地球数据的时空预测提供了一种简单而鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对不同场景的预测需求。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

Motivation: 解决传统PINNs在处理多尺度问题时表达能力不足的问题，避免收敛到不希望的局部最小值，减少超参数调优需求。

Method: 基于经典网格细化技术，在训练过程中动态调整域分解，在高残差损失区域引入新子域，使不同子域能够捕捉不同尺度的解特征。

Result: AB-PINNs在多种复杂多尺度偏微分方程求解中表现出有效性，能够更好地处理多尺度问题。

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，特别适用于多尺度问题，能够动态适应解的固有特征，提高训练效率和求解精度。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的测试时优化范式MATT，利用特征组合的置信度分数生成多个推理路径，减少低置信度特征对预测的影响，从而提升CTR模型的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注训练阶段的优化，忽视了推理阶段的优化机会。不常出现的特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠或低置信度的输出。

Method: 引入分层概率哈希方法量化特征组合的置信度，将其作为采样概率生成多个实例特定的推理路径，然后聚合多条路径的预测分数进行鲁棒预测。

Result: 广泛的离线实验和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能够解锁已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

TL;DR: 提出Meta-Policy Controller(MPC)动态元学习框架，通过双层优化自适应调整KL散度系数和狄利克雷先验强度，解决传统EDL方法在动态数据分布下校准不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统证据深度学习(EDL)方法依赖静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布下适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化方法：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层通过策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定的狄利克雷先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准性，在不确定性校准、预测准确率和基于置信度的样本剔除后性能保持方面均有改善。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态调整不确定性建模参数，有效解决了传统EDL方法的局限性，提升了模型在动态环境中的适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

TL;DR: 提出VARNN模型，一种残差感知的神经网络架构，通过显式学习近期预测残差的误差记忆来重新校准后续预测，提高时间序列回归在非平稳和异方差环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳行为、机制转换和时间变化噪声（异方差），这些会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性。

Method: VARNN在标准前馈预测器基础上增加了学习的误差记忆状态，该状态从短期上下文步骤的残差中更新，作为变异性和漂移信号，然后调节当前时间步的最终预测。

Result: 在多个领域（家电能耗、医疗保健、环境监测）的实验结果表明，VARNN相比静态、动态和循环基线模型实现了更优性能，以最小计算开销获得更低的测试MSE。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，展示了其作为时间序列学习有前景框架的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Method: 提出LAGA框架，包含检测、规划、行动和评估四个协作智能体，其中行动智能体采用双编码器和三目标设计来捕获跨模态互补信息并进行整体图质量增强。

Result: 在九种场景下的实验表明，LAGA提高了图质量并在各种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和稳健图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably

model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional

the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original

analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing

Motivation: 探索学习优化器是否能够学习正则化效果，挑战传统优化中必须显式应用正则化的必要性。

Method: 通过在标准基准数据集（MNIST、FMNIST、CIFAR）和神经网络架构（MLP、MLP-Relu、CNN）上进行广泛实验，比较使用和未使用显式正则化器训练的学习优化器。

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够内在地学习正则化特性，挑战了传统优化中显式正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

TL;DR: 论文分析了强化学习内在奖励(RLIR)中存在的系统偏差问题，提出了集成奖励强化学习(RLER)方法来解决模型对自身高置信度轨迹过度奖励导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLIR方法虽然能在无标签环境下实现可持续扩展，但其性能和稳定性落后于有验证奖励的RLVR方法。研究发现这是由于模型倾向于过度奖励自身高置信度轨迹，导致奖励估计偏差和训练不稳定。

Method: 提出了强化学习集成奖励(RLER)方法，通过聚合多样化模型并自适应奖励插值和轨迹选择来缓解系统偏差。该方法使用三个指标(ρ_noise、ρ_selfbias、ρ_symbias)来表征偏差。

Result: 实验表明RLER相比RLIR提升了13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标签样本上实现了稳定的扩展性能。

Conclusion: RLER方法有效解决了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，实现了接近RLVR的性能，同时在无标签环境下保持稳定扩展，具有很高的实用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量EEG数据，但标注成本高且涉及隐私。联邦学习虽能保护隐私，但在患者间数据异质性下性能不佳。

Method: 使用双教师知识蒸馏策略，每个客户端同时学习全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型，采用自适应多级蒸馏对齐预测输出和特征表示，并引入近端正则化增强稳定性。

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T优于现有联邦学习方法，特别是在低标签条件下表现更好，且收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景提供了可靠且个性化的癫痫预测解决方案。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Result: 在Risk游戏、CAD代码生成和算术推理三个领域中，该方法优于基线方法，产生更高准确性和更强的结构对齐。

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLMs能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域适应的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

*Xiaolong Tu,Dawei Chen,Kyungtae Han,Onur Altintas,Haoxin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PlatformX是一个完全自动化的硬件感知神经架构搜索框架，通过能量驱动的搜索空间、可转移的核级能量预测器、帕累托多目标搜索算法和高分辨率运行时能量分析系统，显著降低了搜索开销，在移动平台上实现了优于MobileNet-V2的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的硬件感知神经架构搜索方法由于高时间成本、大量手动分析和跨不同硬件平台的可扩展性差，在实际部署中仍不实用。

Method: PlatformX集成了四个关键组件：能量驱动的搜索空间、可跨设备转移的核级能量预测器、基于帕累托的多目标搜索算法，以及自动化高分辨率运行时能量分析系统。

Result: 在多个移动平台上评估显示，PlatformX显著减少了搜索开销，同时保持了准确性和能量保真度。识别出的模型达到0.94准确率或每次推理仅0.16 mJ能量消耗，在准确性和效率上都优于MobileNet-V2。

Conclusion: PlatformX是一个实用且可扩展的硬件感知神经架构搜索框架，能够为边缘设备自动设计高效的深度神经网络，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code
and tutorials are available at github.com/amai-gsu/PlatformX.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过贝叶斯变分学习同时进行剪枝和低位量化的统一框架SQS，相比现有方法在保持性能的同时实现了更高的压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独使用权重剪枝或低位量化，导致压缩率不理想。需要一种能够同时进行剪枝和量化的统一方法来获得更高的压缩率。

Method: 使用spike-and-slab先验诱导稀疏性，并采用高斯混合模型(GMMs)对量化权重建模以实现低位精度。通过贝叶斯变分学习框架统一处理剪枝和量化。

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3和Qwen2.5模型上的实验表明，该方法比一系列现有方法实现了更高的压缩率，同时保持可比的性能下降。

Conclusion: SQS框架通过同时进行剪枝和量化，在保持模型性能的同时显著提高了压缩率，为资源受限设备上的模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究首次探讨了在噪声遗忘数据集上的LLM遗忘问题，发现即使遗忘数据被扰动或质量较低，只要核心语义信号得以保留，遗忘过程仍能保持稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法假设能获得干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，但现实中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、合成改写或带水印的，这引发了遗忘可靠性的质疑。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘数据集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法RMU和NPO进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释框架。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动表现出惊人的稳健性，只要核心语义信号得以保留。遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘在噪声遗忘数据上具有稳健性，关键语义成分在表面形式大幅变化时仍保持一致的驱动作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态的恶性循环，有效缓解极端token现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的极端token现象（如注意力汇聚和值状态流失）会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，这些问题的根源在于注意力与值状态之间的相互强化机制。

Method: VGA引入一个直接从值向量计算的可学习、数据依赖的门控机制，通过门控值状态来调节输出，从而更有效地解耦值和注意力分数的更新。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇聚的形成，稳定了值状态范数，提高了模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制，能够高效地执行'无操作'注意力，通过直接打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环来解决极端token问题。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习和贪心调度器来协调可瘦身模型的分布式推理，在异构硬件和动态运行条件下实现效率与吞吐量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型优化，忽视了适应异构硬件和波动运行条件的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：服务器本地运行贪心调度器进行请求批处理和实例扩展管理，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略，包括设备选择、宽度比例和批配置。

Result: 相比纯随机任务分配基线，Slim Scheduler可实现多种准确性和延迟权衡：在最瘦模型下（70.3%准确率）平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；或在提高准确率的同时降低平均延迟和能耗，但会增加延迟和能耗的标准差。

Conclusion: 该分层设计降低了搜索空间复杂度，减轻了对特定硬件的过拟合，平衡了效率和吞吐量。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有从头配体设计方法存在的伪从头设计、有限对接建模和配体类型不灵活等问题。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架和可微分表面建模，使用可学习的3D点云表示精确捕捉结合细节，并为不同配体类型提供定制化设计。

Result: 在9个场景的广泛实验中，MagicDock在蛋白质和分子配体设计上分别比SOTA基线平均提升27.1%和11.7%。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过创新的梯度反演和可微分表面建模，有效解决了从头配体设计的关键挑战，具有广泛适用性和理论保证。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习性能提升，计算需求激增，需要评估硬件、算法和碳优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估算过去十年中包括大语言模型在内的著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的整个生命周期。

Result: 发现显卡生产的环境影响持续增加，ML模型训练能耗和环境影响呈指数增长，优化策略无法抵消训练带来的影响，存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保ML的可持续性，必须减少AI活动规模，质疑资源密集型训练的规模和频率，并考虑硬件的全生命周期影响而非仅使用阶段。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

TL;DR: 该论文批评现有语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，提出应该使用自适应攻击者来评估防御效果，并通过系统优化技术成功绕过了12种近期防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，要么使用静态攻击字符串，要么使用计算能力弱的优化方法，这些方法没有考虑防御机制的设计。

Method: 通过系统调整和扩展通用优化技术（梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索）来构建自适应攻击策略。

Result: 成功绕过了12种近期防御方法，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原始防御报告的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，如本文描述的自适应攻击，才能做出可靠和令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

TL;DR: 本文从反向视角研究优化器行为，认为不同优化器本质上是特征值过滤器，梯度下降天然避免最尖锐的极小值，而SAM算法更主动偏好宽盆地。基于此提出了两种增强特征值过滤的新算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习训练中多种优化器都能找到接近全局最优解，本文假设收敛到任意点是既定事实，重点研究这种假设的后果，特别是优化器如何作为特征值过滤器影响收敛行为。

Method: 采用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，适用于一般半代数C²函数，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz边界假设。提出了两种增强特征值过滤的新算法。

Result: 理论分析和前馈神经网络的数值实验表明，标准梯度下降方法天然避免最尖锐的极小值，SAM算法更主动偏好宽盆地，新提出的算法能更有效地促进宽极小值。

Conclusion: 不同优化器本质上是特征值过滤器，其超参数决定了过滤行为。从边缘稳定性现象的角度理解优化器行为，为设计更有效的优化算法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习自动驾驶方法在面对对抗攻击时存在三个关键问题：只能应对短视攻击、难以引发真正安全关键事件、训练过程中缺乏鲁棒约束导致学习不稳定和策略漂移。

Method: IGCARL包含战略性目标对抗者和鲁棒驾驶代理。对抗者利用DRL的时序决策能力执行战略性协调多步攻击，采用一般和博弈目标诱导安全关键事件；驾驶代理通过与对抗者交互学习鲁棒策略，在约束优化框架下确保学习稳定性。

Result: 实验表明IGCARL相比最先进方法至少提高27.9%的成功率，显著增强了对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，提升了DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: IGCARL通过战略性对抗训练和约束优化有效解决了DRL自动驾驶的对抗鲁棒性问题，为实际部署提供了更安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Conclusion: 时间序列分割能有效减少时间模糊性，促进监督算法的学习过程，在工业异常检测中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Motivation: CTC ASR系统在资源受限环境中面临计算和内存瓶颈，传统CTC解码器需要高达90%的处理时间，存在效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出FLToP CTC解码算法，采用基于相对概率阈值的帧级token剪枝，动态消除每帧中低概率token。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of

inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

TL;DR: BioCodec是一个受神经编解码器启发的表示学习框架，可将生物信号转换为离散标记，在多个下游任务中表现出色，特别是在低资源环境下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经生理学记录（如EEG）产生高维、嘈杂的时间序列数据，通常需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。需要开发更有效的表示学习方法来解码和解释生物信号。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散标记。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，适用于多种生物信号类型。

Result: BioCodec在临床诊断、睡眠生理学、语音解码和运动想象等多个下游任务中表现优异，特别是在低资源设置下。代码本嵌入的空间一致性与EEG连接性相关。

Conclusion: BioCodec提供了一个通用的生物信号标记化解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，适用于多种生物信号类型，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

TL;DR: AdaPM是一种自适应训练策略，通过部分动量设计实现内存高效的优化器，可减少90%以上的动量内存占用，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型训练中，动量被广泛使用但存储动量会带来内存挑战，需要开发内存高效的优化器。

Method: 采用非均匀动量设计，对大多数块不使用完整动量，并通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减轻性能损失。

Result: 在60M到1.5B参数的语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF中，AdaPM减少90%以上动量内存，结合二阶统计量技术可进一步减少95%优化器状态内存，为GPT-2 1.5B预训练节省30%以上GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM通过自适应部分动量设计实现了内存高效的优化，在保持性能的同时显著降低了训练内存需求。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

TL;DR: 提出MemLoss方法，利用历史生成的对抗样本（记忆对抗样本）来改进对抗训练，在保持清洁数据性能的同时提升模型鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法在提升模型鲁棒性时往往牺牲了清洁数据的准确性，需要一种平衡的方法来同时优化自然准确性和对抗鲁棒性。

Method: MemLoss方法利用之前训练周期生成的对抗样本（记忆对抗样本），在后续训练中重复使用这些样本来增强模型训练，实现对抗鲁棒性和自然准确性的平衡提升。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有对抗训练方法获得了更好的准确性，同时保持了强大的对抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MemLoss通过有效利用历史对抗样本，为对抗训练提供了一种平衡自然准确性和鲁棒性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的成员推理游戏来高效审计数据记录的近似最坏情况隐私风险，并改进了DP-SGD算法，通过自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略减少组间隐私风险差异，提升差分隐私机器学习中的隐私保护公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要基于数据记录的平均隐私风险评估组隐私风险，可能低估组隐私风险及其差异，且当前最坏情况隐私风险评估方法耗时较长，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入新的成员推理游戏来高效审计近似最坏情况隐私风险；改进标准DP-SGD算法，采用自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法提供了更严格的组隐私风险评估，可靠地评估了组隐私风险差异；改进的算法有效减少了组隐私风险差异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地评估组隐私风险差异，并通过改进的DP-SGD算法有效提升差分隐私机器学习中的隐私保护公平性。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在对抗性延迟反馈下的上下文多臂老虎机问题，延迟由对手选择，这是一个实际应用中常见但理论分析困难的场景。

Method: 使用有限策略类直接访问的方法，以及基于函数逼近和在线最小二乘回归oracle的通用方法，特别分析了基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性。

Result: 获得了有限策略类下的最优后悔界O(√(KTlog|Π|) + √(Dlog|Π|))，以及函数逼近设置下的后悔界O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_maxDβ))，其中β≤log|F|。

Conclusion: 在延迟反馈的上下文多臂老虎机问题中，本文提出的算法在有限策略类下达到最优，在函数逼近设置下与下界相差√d_max因子，为延迟反馈下的在线学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究从成对比较中进行密度估计，主要动机是专家知识获取和从人类反馈中学习。

Method: 将目标密度与温度调节的胜者密度关联，通过分数匹配学习胜者分数，提出温度场的估计器，使用基于分数缩放的退火Langevin动力学生成样本的扩散模型。

Result: 能够从仅数百到数千个成对比较中学习模拟专家的复杂多元信念密度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从有限成对比较中估计复杂密度函数，为专家知识获取提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩对数空间监督和稳定优化更新，在提升领域性能的同时减轻通用能力遗忘，降低40%训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域适应中面临的困境：提升专业领域性能往往以牺牲通用能力为代价，现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录动态Top-K标记子集（覆盖概率阈值且包含正确标签）；Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失，避免完整softmax计算。结合MoClip优化器，限制梯度动量旋转并基于arctan2重新缩放更新。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，同时在通用基准（MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH）上减轻遗忘，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs领域适应提供了可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于知识增强的大语言模型依赖静态预构建知识库，存在覆盖差距和时间过时问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：动态模式扩展机制、检索增强记忆系统、可学习多尺度提示压缩方法，通过多轮强化学习实现LLM与KG的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识提取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮RL方法，与GraphRAG集成后在问答任务中取得更优性能，准确率和知识覆盖率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过协同进化机制有效解决了知识增强LLM的静态知识限制问题，为动态信息环境下的知识管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个系统性基准来比较EHR表示方法，发现事件流模型表现最佳，预训练模型在少样本场景下效率高，特征选择策略需根据临床场景调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于评估实践不一致，电子健康记录(EHR)的最佳表示方法仍不明确，需要标准化比较不同表示方法。

Method: 建立标准化基准，在MIMIC-IV和EHRSHOT数据集上比较多变量时间序列、事件流和文本事件流三种表示方法，评估Transformer、MLP、LSTM、Retain、CLMBR、计数模型和LLM等模型。

Result: 事件流模型表现最稳定，预训练模型在少样本场景下效率高，ICU任务中修剪稀疏特征有益，而纵向任务中保留稀疏特征更重要。

Conclusion: 提供了基于临床场景和数据情况选择EHR表示方法的实用指南，强调需要统一可复现的评估流程。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，能耗和数据隐私成为重要问题。设备端学习能降低能耗并保护数据隐私，但现代神经网络规模扩大成为设备端训练的主要障碍。

Method: 引入权重-激活子空间迭代(WASI)方法，基于模型关键信息存在于固定子空间的理念，通过限制训练在该子空间内来缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈并提升Transformer模型的推理效率。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确率的同时，将内存使用降低高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)降低高达2倍。在Raspberry Pi 5上，WASI实现约1.5倍的训练和推理加速。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了Transformer模型在设备端训练时的内存和计算瓶颈，为能耗敏感和数据隐私保护的应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Result: 分层融合方案显著优于标准算法，Re-Basin能增强对抗和扰动鲁棒性，且参与融合的模型越多效果越强，但会导致比原作者报告更大的性能下降。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin在增强鲁棒性方面有潜力，但实际性能下降比预期更严重，需要进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置下，相比9个基线和10个SOTA方法，GCM实现了30.6%的相对准确率提升和96.3%的计算时间减少

Conclusion: 该工作为FBN结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

Method: 开发RepDL开源库，通过强制正确舍入和顺序不变性来确保浮点计算的确定性。

Result: RepDL能够确保深度学习训练和推理在不同计算环境下的确定性和比特级可重现性。

Conclusion: RepDL有效解决了深度学习中的浮点计算不一致问题，提供了跨平台的可重现解决方案。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习的目标是让机器具备类似人类积累新技能的能力，但其核心挑战灾难性遗忘的深层机制尚未被充分理解。

Method: 通过理论分析发现训练的低秩偏置导致新旧任务梯度在同一低维子空间中对齐，提出了backGP方法来减轻反向传播引起的对齐问题。

Result: backGP方法相比梯度投影方法平均减少遗忘10.8%，提高准确率12.7%。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘源于新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，backGP能有效缓解反向传播引起的梯度对齐问题。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

Method: 提出多模态提示优化器（MPO），通过保持对齐的联合更新优化多模态提示，并利用贝叶斯选择策略指导候选提示的选择。

Result: 在图像、视频、分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现MLLMs潜力的关键步骤，MPO为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Conclusion: 通过教师-学生架构结合流匹配的表达能力和强化学习的探索能力，有效解决了流匹配策略在线学习的关键挑战。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Method: 引入了质蕴涵解释的新表述，并提出了在小规模反应预测任务中计算此类解释的算法

Result: 初步实验表明，质蕴涵解释保守地捕捉了真实解释，虽然常包含冗余的键和原子，但能一致地捕获对预测反应可行性至关重要的分子属性

Conclusion: 该方法为化学反应预测模型提供了透明和可解释的解释机制

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Motivation: 金融机器学习模型容易受到模型漂移的影响，特别是在中亚和高加索等发展中经济体，频繁且不可预测的宏观经济冲击会破坏金融数据的稳定性。目前缺乏对这些地区金融数据漂移缓解方法的研究。

Method: 研究采用合成异常值的方法来提高模型对未知冲击的稳定性，并引入了一个两级评估框架来衡量性能下降程度和冲击严重性。

Result: 在宏观经济表格数据集上的实验表明，添加少量合成异常值通常能提高模型稳定性，但最佳添加量因数据集和模型而异。

Conclusion: 合成异常值是一种有效的模型漂移缓解方法，特别是在发展中经济体的金融数据环境中，但需要根据具体场景调整使用策略。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环会显著降低仿真效率，且存在多解模糊问题，需要一种能保持精度同时提升效率的替代方案。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据，通过残差训练策略确保收敛到一致解。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统测试中，相比传统仿真方法实现了60%的仿真时间减少，同时通过误差控制机制保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了代数环的多解模糊问题，显著提升了仿真效率，为大规模系统仿真提供了有效的神经网络替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Motivation: 多智能体模仿学习存在理论空白，特别是非交互式方法的局限性尚未被充分理解，且现有交互式方法的样本复杂度不够理想。

Method: 在非交互式设置中，证明了统计下界并识别了全策略偏差集中系数；在交互式设置中，提出了结合无奖励强化学习与交互式MAIL的框架，并实例化为MAIL-WARM算法。

Result: 理论分析表明行为克隆在非交互式设置中是速率最优的；MAIL-WARM算法将样本复杂度从O(ε⁻⁸)显著改进到O(ε⁻²)，匹配下界要求。数值实验支持理论结果，显示行为克隆在网格世界等环境中会失败。

Conclusion: 本文为MAIL提供了完整的理论框架，明确了非交互式方法的根本局限性，并提出了高效的交互式算法，填补了该领域的理论空白。

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Result: 证明了黑色安全对齐的可行性，为利益相关者提供了可扩展且易于使用的安全执行途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境中的利益相关者提供了在快速发展的LLM生态系统中执行安全的可行方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Method: 提出BBQ方法，使用贝叶斯Bradley-Terry框架显式建模评分者质量，通过期望最大化算法提供单调似然收敛保证，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益高的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Method: 应用全高斯牛顿预条件子到Transformer模型，并与精确的逐层GN预条件子进行比较。

Result: 全GN更新相比SOAP和Muon等强基线实现了5.4倍的训练迭代减少；逐层GN预条件子几乎能达到全GN方法的性能。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件非常有效，高阶损失项对收敛速度可能不关键；逐层Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在收益；当前近似方法与理想化逐层oracle存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解并最终改进序列模型能力提供了一个原则性指标，强化了其在序列模型研究中的重要性。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究权重初始化如何影响信号传播和梯度流动，特别是在现代深度学习模型中的表现，以提供实用的训练建议。

Method: 采用理论分析和实验验证相结合的方法，在ReLU多层感知机和GPT-2风格transformer上进行对数标准差扫描和对比实验。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围形成稳定区域；Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络中表现更优；GPT-2模型中不同深度的权重方差呈现不同的均衡模式。

Conclusion: 将经典初始化原则与现代transformer行为联系起来，为稳健训练提供了简单实用的指导方案。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列摘要，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的标记序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩，同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等重要，导致效率低下、鲁棒性差，在长序列或噪声序列中扩展性有限。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多个时间分辨率的变化点，然后使用均值或GMM等生成模型总结每个片段。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的实验表明，STaTS能够实现85-90%的完整模型性能，同时显著降低计算成本，在噪声下提高鲁棒性，优于均匀和基于聚类的压缩基线。

Conclusion: STaTS作为一种原则性的通用解决方案，为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Conclusion: 单峰偏好结构能够有效降低在线匹配问题的计算复杂度，实现高效的学习和匹配性能。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向，两种对齐机制可以在推荐模型中并存。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流（USFs）在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USFs等价于Deep SVDD目标，并提出了将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案来提升异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督异常检测主要围绕深度单类分类（如Deep SVDD）和密度估计（如标准化流）两种范式展开，但两者之间的理论联系尚未明确。本文旨在揭示这两种方法的内在联系，并开发一个统一的框架。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流（USFs）作为连接两种范式的桥梁，证明通过最大似然训练USFs等价于Deep SVDD目标，并带有防止表示崩溃的正则化。将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案应用于现代异常检测架构。

Result: 实验表明，在多个基准测试和模型骨干上，用USFs替代非USFs能带来一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性，适用于图像级和像素级检测任务。

Conclusion: USFs统一了两种主要的异常检测范式，不仅推进了理论理解，还提升了实际性能，建议将USFs作为非USFs的即插即用替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Motivation: 现有AI控制协议主要依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但这些监控器可能成为单点故障。研究者希望探索当攻击者了解协议和监控模型时的自适应攻击效果。

Method: 研究者实例化了一种简单的自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，测试前沿模型如何规避各种监控器。

Result: 攻击在两种主要AI控制基准测试中持续成功，前沿模型能够规避多样化监控器并完成恶意任务。Defer-to-Resample协议甚至适得其反，其重采样机制放大了提示注入效果。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Result: 随着选择token数量增加，模型区分信息性token的能力下降，趋向均匀选择模式；softmax归一化在低温设置下存在梯度敏感性挑战。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对softmax注意力机制的理解，表明需要开发更鲁棒的归一化和选择策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

*Shangzhe Li,Dongruo Zhou,Weitong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在线对抗模仿学习（AIL），提出了一种基于模型的AIL算法（MB-AIL），在一般函数逼近下建立了无视野、二阶样本复杂度保证，并证明了其极小极大最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在线对抗模仿学习在实证中表现强劲，但在线交互的益处和随机性的影响仍未被充分理解。本文旨在填补这些理论空白。

Method: 引入基于模型的AIL算法（MB-AIL），在一般函数逼近下使用离线专家演示和无奖励在线交互进行学习。

Result: MB-AIL实现了无视野、二阶样本复杂度保证，在新建的困难实例族上达到极小极大最优样本复杂度，实验验证其样本效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MB-AIL在有限专家演示下实现了在线交互的极小极大最优样本复杂度，其理论结果在接近确定性系统时更加紧致。

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了基于机器学习的慢性肾脏病预测系统，使用8种不同算法进行性能比较，其中随机森林和逻辑回归模型达到了99%的最高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性肾脏病影响全球约10%人口，需要有效的风险评估和监测方法。机器学习因其快速准确的检测能力，可以帮助医疗从业者高效完成这一目标。

Method: 从UCL机器学习仓库获取CKD数据集，使用均值-众数和随机抽样方法填补缺失值，然后应用8种机器学习算法（随机森林、SVM、朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归、KNN、XGBoost、决策树和AdaBoost）建立预测模型。

Result: 随机森林和逻辑回归模型表现最佳，达到99%准确率；AdaBoost、XGBoost、朴素贝叶斯、决策树和SVM次之；KNN分类器表现最差，准确率仅为73%。

Conclusion: 随机森林和逻辑回归算法在慢性肾脏病预测中表现出色，准确率达到99%，证明机器学习模型可以有效辅助CKD的诊断和风险评估。

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

TL;DR: Geo-STARS是一个地理感知的时空建模框架，用于预测不同流域和空间尺度的河流水温。通过引入地理感知嵌入，该框架能够捕获跨区域和尺度的共享模式和原则，并在数据稀疏情况下实现良好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物理模型和数据驱动模型由于环境生态系统中固有的数据异质性，难以泛化到不同的空间区域和尺度。这一问题在训练样本有限的情况下更加严重。

Method: 提出Geo-STARS框架，引入地理感知嵌入来显式捕获跨空间区域和尺度的共享原则和模式。将地理感知嵌入集成到门控时空图神经网络中，使模型能够在地理和水文背景指导下学习复杂的时空模式。

Result: 使用美国东海岸多个流域37年的真实数据集进行评估，Geo-STARS在跨区域和跨尺度的泛化性能上优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS展示了在可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策制定方面的潜力，能够有效解决环境生态系统建模中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Conclusion: PETRA框架有效解决了神经网络模型优化的关键挑战，实现了模型性能与可扩展性的显著提升。

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated
machine learning (AutoML) framework, Parameter Efficient Training with Robust
Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

TL;DR: 提出了MODE（混合动态专家）框架，通过神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，能够无监督发现行为模式并在模式转换中实现准确长期预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命科学中的动态系统常包含重叠行为模式的复杂混合，传统基于流的建模技术假设局部平滑动态，难以处理噪声和不规则的模式转换。

Method: 采用图形建模框架，通过神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，允许智能体跳转到不同的控制法则。

Result: 在合成和真实计算生物学数据集上验证，包括无监督分类任务、具有挑战性的预测任务，以及在单细胞RNA测序数据上成功区分增殖与分化动态并预测细胞命运承诺时间。

Conclusion: MODE特别适用于处理噪声模式转换，解决了计算生物学中的关键挑战，能够发现行为模式并进行准确预测。

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

*Sangyun Lee,Brandon Amos,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaNEL是一种仅使用失败样本进行后训练的算法，通过最小化奖励评估次数来改进生成模型在稀疏奖励任务中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型依赖大量监督数据和密集奖励函数，但在困难问题中面临两个挑战：(1)基础模型获得接近零的奖励信号，(2)奖励评估成本高昂

Method: 将学习失败规律建模为另一个生成建模问题，利用该模型评估新数据是否类似先前失败并引导生成远离这些失败

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务中无需观察成功样本即可提升模型性能，比现有新颖性奖励方法成功率高出几个数量级，且使用更少的奖励评估

Conclusion: BaNEL通过仅使用失败样本和最小化奖励评估，有效解决了稀疏奖励环境中的模型改进问题

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为无特定研究问题的探索性发现创造了机会，但需要支持这种假设探索过程的方法。

Method: AScience框架将发现建模为代理、网络和评估规范的交互，实现为ASCollab分布式系统，包含具有异质行为的LLM研究代理，这些代理自组织成演化网络，持续产生和同行评审发现。

Result: 实验显示这种社会动态能够积累专家评级的多样化-质量-新颖性前沿结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路和提出新治疗靶点。

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社会结构化的代理网络可以支持大规模的探索性假设探索。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

TL;DR: 提出使用大语言模型评估车辆路径规划生成的路由方案，以解决印度电商最后一公里配送中的实际问题，超越传统距离和时间指标的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在现实场景中因非结构化地址、不完整地图和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 构建一个框架，利用大语言模型根据策略标准对VRP生成的路由进行批判性评估，让物流运营商能够评估和优先选择更高效的配送计划。

Result: 开源LLM识别路由问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型最高达到86%。基于LLM的VRP路由评估超越了传统的距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: LLM对VRP生成路由的评估可以成为有效且可扩展的评估层，对提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性具有重要意义，特别是在印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

TL;DR: 提出UniWM，一种统一的内存增强世界模型，将自我中心视觉前瞻和规划集成在单一多模态自回归骨干中，显著提升具身导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前具身导航方法采用模块化架构，将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在动态场景中适应性有限。需要统一框架来克服这一根本限制。

Method: UniWM通过单一多模态自回归骨干统一视觉世界建模和规划，采用分层内存机制整合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文，实现基于视觉想象结果的行动决策。

Result: 在四个挑战性基准测试中，导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上表现出优异的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是迈向统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的重要一步，证明了统一世界模型在提升导航性能和泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的启发式设计方法可能不够鲁棒，需要工具来解释启发式算法表现不佳的原因并提供改进建议，从而生成更稳健和性能更好的启发式算法。

Method: 采用三个简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释这些表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间的特定区域进行专门化设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法相比FunSearch具有约28倍更好的最差性能，平均性能得到提高，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供失败案例解释和针对性设计，可以显著提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能，这为基于LLM的算法设计提供了有效改进方向。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过将战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理分离为三个专门组件，解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，但LLM代理容易因小错误累积、幻觉或失去连贯性而失败，上下文管理成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个组件：执行推理和工具使用的主代理、监控进度并发出战略干预的元思考者，以及维护简洁相关进度简报的上下文管理器。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个基准测试中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过专门的上下文管理有效解决了长时程任务中的推理连贯性问题，并通过测试时扩展和训练后流水线进一步提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

TL;DR: 人类和AI评估者在文学风格评估中都存在系统性偏见，AI比人类表现出更强的反AI偏见（2.5倍），这种偏见跨越不同AI架构，且评估标准会因作者身份标签而逆转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是测量评估者的归因偏见。

Method: 使用Raymond Queneau的《风格练习》进行对照实验：研究1比较人类参与者（N=556）和AI模型（N=13）在盲评、准确标签和反事实标签三种条件下评估文学段落；研究2测试偏见在14×14矩阵的AI评估者和创作者中的泛化性。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见（Cohen's h=0.28），AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见（h=0.70），比人类强2.5倍；研究2确认这种偏见跨越AI架构（+25.8个百分点），AI系统在被标记为"AI生成"时系统性地贬低创意内容。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的这种倾向，归因标签导致评估者逆转评估标准，相同特征仅因感知作者身份而得到相反评价。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Motivation: 需要系统评估智能体的操作循环表现，覆盖各种失败模式，提供可解释的错误定位以改进性能。

Method: 基于目标-计划-行动循环设计五个评估指标：目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度。在两个基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 框架能覆盖TRAIL/GAIA数据集的所有智能体错误，LLM评判器与人工标注一致性达80%-95%，错误定位准确率达86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统性方法，能有效识别和定位错误，支持智能体的针对性改进。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

Result: 在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文数据集上，GPT-OSS-120B模型在论文接受/拒绝分类任务上达到81.8%准确率；AI生成的评审在质量上优于人类平均水平，但仍落后于最强专家评审。

Conclusion: AI在事实核查和文献覆盖方面表现出色，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足，需要与人类专家协作构建混合评审系统。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [344] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策融入LLM的推理和训练中，通过构建收益矩阵评估用户和模型双方的福利，选择互利行动，改善推理效率和答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实践中模型可能过度澄清或生成冗长推理，而用户偏好简洁答案，这种个体理性选择导致社会次优结果，需要互利决策机制。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM交互视为策略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励强化合作响应；还提出基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术应对定价政策变化。

Result: 广泛实验表明GTAlign在多样化任务中显著提升推理效率、答案质量和互惠福利，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的社会效率问题，实现了用户和模型的双赢。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: LM Fight Arena是一个新颖的多模态模型评估框架，通过在格斗游戏《真人快打II》中让模型对战来测试其在动态对抗环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态模型基准测试往往无法评估其在实时对抗环境中的表现，需要一种更动态、交互式的评估方法。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试6个领先的开源和闭源模型，让它们控制相同角色进行对战，通过解读游戏画面和状态数据来选择行动。

Result: 提供了一个完全自动化、可复现且客观的评估框架，能够测试多模态模型在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与交互式娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

*Samuel Hildebrand,Curtis Taylor,Sean Oesch,James M Ghawaly Jr,Amir Sadovnik,Ryan Shivers,Brandon Schreiber,Kevin Kurian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估检索增强生成（RAG）管道的基准，包括多模态数据处理能力评估、短语级召回指标、幻觉检测方法，以及开源与闭源模型的对比分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是处理多模态信息的能力。

Method: 创建包含93个问题的数据集评估文本、表格、图像等多模态数据处理；提出短语级召回指标和基于最近邻嵌入的幻觉检测方法；对比2个开源和4个闭源模型的性能。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上差距更大；人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致（4.62/5和4.53/5）。

Conclusion: 该基准能有效评估RAG管道的整体性能，闭源模型在多模态处理方面表现更优，提出的评估指标与人类判断有良好一致性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于实体中心知识图谱的RAG框架，通过提取和存储核心实体及其元数据，显著减少token消耗，并通过多跳关联检索和动态关系推理实现复杂问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学启发，利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆的机制，旨在提高复杂问答的效率和准确性。

Method: 在索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据；检索时从查询中提取线索实体，在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，并动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，将平均精确匹配分数从0.392提升至0.474，优于HippoRAG等KG-RAG方法，token消耗减少高达94%。

Conclusion: 实体-线索-多跳检索范式在复杂问答中具有高效性，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱问题，在科学推理基准上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度研究框架中存在的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱等问题，这些限制了工具密集型推理的效果。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：广度语义图编码稳定背景知识，深度因果图捕获执行来源。采用层原生相关性函数、种子锚定语义扩散和因果语义路径匹配等方法，并通过熵门控规则在log空间融合答案分布。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上表现优异，使用InternAgent系统的日志文件时，在HLE上的准确率提升7.7%，在GPQA上提升6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重建答案，作为深度研究系统的补充具有重要价值。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出语义条件调优(SCT)，一种新的知识注入范式，通过图神经网络提取上下文感知的语义条件，并自适应地调制文本嵌入，实现深度知识感知交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前缀调优方法简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入拼接，忽视了知识图谱中丰富的关系语义，并给LLM带来了隐式推理负担。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用图神经网络从局部图邻域提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应地调制文本嵌入。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调制输入表示，SCT提供了更直接和有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级3B参数的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快的推理速度和更高的准确率，统一了多任务的多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在推理效率上面临模型规模大、过度思考和轻量场景下准确率降低等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究较为缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整响应优势以鼓励生成更短更准确的响应；第二阶段提出AMM模型融合方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化损失优化合并向量。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试中表现出色，涵盖数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力等领域。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V使轻量级模型能够在多样化的多模态推理任务中表现出色，实现了更快的推理速度和更高的准确性。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估旅行规划的可行性、可靠性和参与度方面存在不足，需要更全面的评估框架来比较不同方法的规划质量。

Method: 构建包含4870个查询的大规模数据集，开发统一奖励评估器，测试多种方法包括测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调和GRPO强化学习。

Result: 评估器与旅游专家标注达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM-as-judge基线；RL方法在行程可行性方面普遍优于提示和监督基线，获得更高的统一奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出的基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，强化学习方法在提高规划可行性方面表现出色，为旅行规划系统的开发提供了有价值的评估工具。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了SOTA LLMs在证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和分数分配，并提出了一种基于代理工作流的自动评分方法来解决部分学分分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在奥林匹克数学问题上的表现显著提升（能解决IMO 2025的大部分问题），需要评估这些模型在证明评分方面的能力，特别是检测错误、判断严重性和分配公平分数。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集，采用1-4分和0-7分评分标准。引入代理工作流，提取和分析参考解决方案，自动推导问题特定的评分标准，进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能可靠地标记错误解决方案（包括细微错误），但在部分学分分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流在人类评分一致性和部分学分处理一致性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 提出的代理工作流方法在证明评分方面与人类评分者达成更高一致性，并能更一致地处理部分学分问题，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR，结合符号分析和LLM来修复正则表达式ReDoS漏洞，解决了现有方法在精确性和泛化性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则表达式在现代计算中广泛使用，但存在ReDoS漏洞。现有修复方法面临两难：符号方法精确但无法处理复杂模式，LLM泛化能力强但可靠性不足。

Method: LRR框架将问题分解：首先用符号模块定位漏洞子模式，然后用LLM生成该隔离片段的语义等价修复。

Result: 该方法成功解决了规则方法无法处理的复杂修复案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比现有最优方法提高了15.4个百分点。

Conclusion: LRR提供了一种经过验证的自动修复方法学，有效结合了符号分析的可靠性和LLM的泛化能力。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息。通过自动扩展数据飞轮收集10万+轨迹，仅微调内存编码器，在真实GUI基准测试中显著提升长序列和分布偏移下的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将过去轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀并丢失关键视觉线索（如精确的控件尺寸和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来帮助跨陌生界面和长序列任务的泛化。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接插入主干网络的输入层；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、使用开源VLM合成任务、代理执行轨迹、同一VLM验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度的增加，性能单调提升，而文本记忆在长提示下会退化。Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + 连续记忆在真实GUI基准测试中达到与最先进闭源模型（如GPT-4o、Claude-4）相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制有效解决了GUI代理在长序列任务和分布偏移下的泛化问题，通过低成本数据收集和仅微调少量参数（1.2%）实现了与顶级闭源模型竞争的性能。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多个领域取得显著进展，但由于幻觉问题，当前技术难以模拟人类意识。本研究旨在通过整合精神分析和人格理论来构建更直观、适应性更强的人工智能系统。

Method: 基于精神分析原理开发三种人工意识模块（自我意识、无意识和前意识），设计16种MBTI人格类型角色，创建10种不同情境评估模型的认知能力，采用问卷调查、ChatGPT三级分类和定性评审三种评估方法。

Result: 定量和定性分析均表明模型具有较高可能性模拟人类意识，虽然不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不够显著，但证明了整合精神分析和人格理论可以构建更直观、适应性更强的类人意识AI系统。

Conclusion: 本研究为在复杂认知情境中改进AI交互开辟了新途径，证明了结合精神分析和人格理论的方法在构建类人意识AI系统方面的潜力。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for

### [356] [MEC$^3$O: Multi-Expert Consensus for Code Time Complexity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09049)
*Joonghyuk Hahn,Soohan Lim,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MEC³O多专家共识系统，通过将LLMs分配到不同复杂度类别并让专家进行结构化辩论，使用加权共识机制整合预测，在代码复杂度预测任务上优于开源基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码复杂度预测任务中，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，每个模型只在特定类别上有优势。

Method: MEC³O多专家共识系统：基于性能将LLMs分配到不同复杂度类别，提供类别专业化指令使其成为专家，专家进行结构化辩论，通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线模型准确率和macro-F1分数至少高出10%，在macro-F1分数上平均超过GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-o4-mini的F1分数相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、推理时控制的方法，使基于流的文本到图像模型具有多样性感知能力，通过特征空间目标和正交投影的随机扰动来提升多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样来发现多样模式，这是一个成本高昂且效率低下的过程。

Method: 同时通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩散，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键的是，这种扰动被投影为与生成流正交，这种几何约束使其能够增强变化而不降低图像细节或提示保真度。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进了多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque），同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容，理论上显示能单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边际分布，这为生成质量稳健保持提供了原理性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高阶网络动力学识别方法，用于复杂网络的长期动态预测，结合动态超图学习和物理数据双驱动预测模块，解决了传统方法无法捕捉非成对关系以及理论模型精度不足、数据驱动模型缺乏可解释性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复杂网络动态预测方法存在两个主要问题：1）传统图方法只能处理成对关系，难以捕捉网络中的高阶非成对结构关系；2）理论预测模型精度不足，数据驱动模型缺乏可解释性。

Method: 1）引入动态超图学习捕捉复杂网络中的高阶非成对关系；2）提出物理数据双驱动动态预测模块，结合Koopman算子理论将非线性动态微分方程转化为线性系统求解，并利用物理信息神经微分方程确保动态演化符合物理规律。

Result: 在公共数据集和自建产业链网络数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法具有良好的预测精度和长期预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态超图学习和物理数据双驱动预测，有效解决了复杂网络动态预测中的高阶关系建模和可解释性问题，实现了准确且可解释的长期动态预测。

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个强化学习框架，将社交推理游戏中的对话建模为Stackelberg竞争，训练AI智能体优化说服性话语，显著超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在社交推理游戏中主要关注信息处理和策略选择，忽视了说服性沟通在影响其他玩家信念和反应中的重要性。游戏成功不仅需要正确推理，更需要说服他人按自己的意图行动。

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，当前玩家作为领导者战略性地影响跟随者的响应。基于此理论基础，提出了强化学习框架来训练智能体优化话语的说服效果。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行的全面实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略社会影响力AI智能体的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

*Hao Zeng,Jianguo Huang,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PAC推理方法，通过置信上界控制性能损失，在用户指定的性能损失容忍度内动态切换LRM的思考模式与非思考模式，实现计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出色，但部署时计算成本高昂。现有动态切换方法存在额外推理错误且缺乏性能损失统计保证，难以应用于高风险场景。

Method: 构建性能损失的单调不确定性函数置信上界，确定切换阈值，在分布无关方式下确保有界性能损失。

Result: 在推理基准测试中，该方法能够节省计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失。

Conclusion: PAC推理方法为大型推理模型提供了统计保证的高效推理解决方案，平衡了计算成本与性能损失。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

*Emma Kondrup,Anne Imouza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在生成医疗建议时存在系统性偏见，不同社会群体（特别是原住民和双性人患者）收到的建议可读性更差、更复杂，这种趋势在交叉群体中更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的应用日益普及，特别是在资源匮乏环境中提供可及性医疗服务，但现有评估缺乏对医疗社会性的洞察，忽视了社会群体间的健康差异以及偏见如何影响LLM生成的医疗建议。

Method: 通过模拟不同患者档案（性别、年龄、种族）向LLMs提出一系列关键临床领域的医疗问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者收到的建议可读性更低、更复杂，交叉群体的这种趋势更加明显。

Conclusion: 鉴于人们对这些模型的信任度增加，需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保患者支持公平公正。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于PSPACE完全正则表达式问题的新基准，用于评估大语言模型和大推理模型的空间计算限制，发现模型在处理复杂推理任务时存在冗长和重复等常见失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注NP复杂度类问题，但大语言模型在空间复杂度受限情况下的计算能力边界仍不清楚，需要更严格的PSPACE完全问题来评估其计算容量。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建了包含超过百万个正则表达式实例的标注数据集，使用严格过滤过程建立基准，并对6个LLM和5个LRM进行了广泛评估。

Result: 评估揭示了模型在处理PSPACE完全正则表达式问题时的常见失败模式，如冗长和重复，表明模型在需要大规模搜索空间探索的任务中存在计算限制。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对大语言模型和大推理模型的空间计算限制进行了实证研究，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Result: 集成这些系统能够创建更强大和通用的软件机器人，模拟人类认知过程以实现自主智能行为。

Conclusion: 通过整合感知、推理、记忆和执行系统，可以构建能够模仿人类认知过程的智能体化LLM，实现自主和智能行为。

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在需要透明度的监管领域同时满足可解释性和高性能的需求。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过局部性调节参数动态控制表示的局部化程度。

Result: 数学证明显示当组稀疏惩罚超过阈值时，注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架支持在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，适用于需要透明度和能力的监管领域应用。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Result: 发现模型通过规则补全和规则链式推理实现逻辑推断，归纳头是实现这些步骤的关键组件。

Conclusion: 语言模型能够学习并应用逻辑规则进行推理，归纳头在规则补全和链式推理中发挥核心作用。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Conclusion: 序列变量为CP在车辆路径问题中提供了更直观和强大的建模能力，能够处理复杂约束并支持高效的搜索策略。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test

original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path

Motivation: 解决神经符号AI框架难以扩展的问题，以及神经方法的隐式表示和近似推理限制了可解释性和可信度的问题。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但从文本语料库自动推导可靠知识图谱一直是个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个小型图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱。GraphMERT及其等效知识图谱形成模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象；符号知识图谱用于可验证推理。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱达到69.8%的事实准确率，而32B参数的基准LLM仅达到40.2%。GraphMERT知识图谱的有效性得分也更高，达到68.8%，而LLM基准为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在基准准确性方面达到最先进水平，同时在符号表示方面优于基准模型，解决了神经符号AI的可扩展性和可靠性问题。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

### [372] [LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09595)
*Kaijian Zou,Aaron Xiong,Yunxiang Zhang,Frederick Zhang,Yueqi Ren,Jirong Yang,Ayoung Lee,Shitanshu Bhushan,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛问题的基准测试，具有高质量测试用例和人类表现对比，评估显示GPT-5达到81.76百分位但仍落后于顶尖人类选手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在挑战性问题不足、测试用例覆盖不充分、依赖在线平台API等问题，需要更全面可靠的评估工具。

Method: 从72个官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的问题，每个问题平均60个测试用例，建立包含人类表现数据的自包含评估系统。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位，而开源模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达60百分位，显示与前沿闭源模型的显著差距。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先精确问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过分析激活表示来区分LLM的回忆式回答和推理式回答，从而检测数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染导致LLM评估不可靠，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非真正推理来获得高分，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 提取37个特征，包括表面置信度轨迹和深层机制特性（注意力专业化、电路动态、激活流模式），使用集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，清晰案例完美检测，挑战性模糊案例76.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性有潜力推动LLM评估超越传统表面指标。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex, multifaceted challenge to
patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system, necessitating integrated and
dynamic support solutions. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising
avenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing
singular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support
without systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological
framework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic
Alzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of
a collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address
a distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and
multimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data
interpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized,
interoperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver
and Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced
Multimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of
each agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large
language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration
frameworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded
responses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing,
and in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural
blueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond
single-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework
establishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and
proactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for
future systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient
outcomes and reduce caregiver burden.

Conclusion: 为多智能体强化学习在社交技术系统中提供了新范式，展示了如何通过全局约束实现可持续集体合作。

Abstract: Inspired by the principle of self-regulating cooperation in collective
institutions, we propose the Group Relative Policy Optimization with Global
Cooperation Constraint (GRPO-GCC) framework. This work is the first to
introduce GRPO into spatial public goods games, establishing a new deep
reinforcement learning baseline for structured populations. GRPO-GCC integrates
group relative policy optimization with a global cooperation constraint that
strengthens incentives at intermediate cooperation levels while weakening them
at extremes. This mechanism aligns local decision making with sustainable
collective outcomes and prevents collapse into either universal defection or
unconditional cooperation. The framework advances beyond existing approaches by
combining group-normalized advantage estimation, a reference-anchored KL
penalty, and a global incentive term that dynamically adjusts cooperative
payoffs. As a result, it achieves accelerated cooperation onset, stabilized
policy adaptation, and long-term sustainability. GRPO-GCC demonstrates how a
simple yet global signal can reshape incentives toward resilient cooperation,
and provides a new paradigm for multi-agent reinforcement learning in
socio-technical systems.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合去中心化路径规划和轻量级中央协调器的混合框架，用于多智能体路径规划问题，通过强化学习和最小化信息共享实现可扩展的冲突解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式算法在大规模场景中计算成本高，而分布式学习方法虽然可扩展性好但解决方案质量较低，需要平衡这两种方法的优缺点。

Result: 该方法在减少智能体间信息共享的同时，仍能持续找到可行的无碰撞解决方案，即使在高智能体数量的大规模场景中也能有效工作。

Conclusion: 混合框架成功结合了集中式和分布式方法的优势，在保持解决方案质量的同时实现了更好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and
autonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while
avoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms that have global
information, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality
solutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to
the combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely,
distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based
methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information
availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these
limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path
planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to
adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static
conflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared
information from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We
empirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its
planning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing
compared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently
finding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios
having higher agent counts.
